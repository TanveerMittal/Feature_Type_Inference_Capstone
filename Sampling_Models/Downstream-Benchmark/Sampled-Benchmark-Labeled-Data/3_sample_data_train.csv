While Bernie Sanders assured cheering supporters at a Los Angeles rally overnight that he plans to keep fighting, Fox News confirmed that the presidential candidate plans to lay off âover halfâ his staff in the next week.  And the math  â   which even he acknowledged  â   does not look good. Clinton pocketed a victory in California, the biggest prize of the night and a state Sanders had fought hard to win. All told, Clinton is projected to win an outright majority of pledged delegates, while reaching the 2, 383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from   âsuperdelegatesâ  â   party officials who can support any candidate they want.  Sanders all along has challenged the legitimacy of those insiders, but at this stage he would need to convince the lionâs share of Clinton superdelegates to abandon her to deny her the nomination on the convention floor, a virtually unprecedented feat. While his supporters egged him on and could be heard booing at the mere mention of Clinton during his early morning rally, his position in the race at this stage would appear to leave them in limbo  â   backing a candidate whose path to the nomination has all but vanished.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â Still, Sanders pledged to campaign through the finale primary Tuesday in Washington, D. C. and go on to the Democratic convention. He vowed to âtake our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. â In a potential move toward reconciliation, the White House revealed that President Obama called both Clinton and Sanders Tuesday night  â   and plans to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday, to discuss âhow to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters.â Clinton earlier claimed victory over Sanders  â   after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win  â   during a lofty speech to supporters in Brooklyn. âThanks to you, weâve reached a milestone,â Clinton declared, upon becoming the first woman in American history to top the ticket of a major political party.  Marking the historic moment, Clinton said: âThis campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits on any of us. â She also congratulated Sanders, calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party  â   while also saying this is a moment to âcome together. â Sandersâ vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Clintonâs superdelegates to force a contested convention. They do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month. Pledged delegates, however, are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucus. Fox News projects that Clinton will still have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention    making it more difficult for Sanders to argue sheâs winning only because of support from superdelegates. Sanders did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakotaâs Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary. A total of six states were voting Tuesday Clinton won the rest. On the GOP side, Donald Trump    the only major Republican left in the race  â   was projected to win the primaries in California, Montana, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico. Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night, winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nomination. Marking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. Trump said: âTonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. â Previewing the general election battle, he slammed the Clintons, alleging they âturned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. â He also appealed to Sanders supporters, saying, âWe welcome you with open arms. â Clinton, in her victory speech, also took shots at Trump, claiming he would âtake America backwards. â âThe stakes in this election are high, and the choice is clear. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president,â she said. The Democratic Party pressure on Sanders, meanwhile, is sure to mount in a matter of days, if not hours. Obama reportedly is planning to get behind Clinton and start campaigning for her, and senior Democrats have been voicing mounting frustration with Sandersâ campaign. At the same time, the senator has touted general election polls suggesting he may be better positioned to go up against Trump in the fall.    ","At its best, the Supreme Court functions precisely as it was intended: as an antidemocratic brake on popular legislative and presidential passions when those passions do violence to the law, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. At its worst  â   and it often has been at its worst of late  â   it functions like Iranâs Guardian Council, a collection of   faqihs and jurists that sits above and outside the political process, using its position and privilege to impose on the nation a narrow set of social values decocted from the political ether. With the death of Antonin Scalia and the prospect of replacing him, we are faced once again with the question: Does the law mean what it says, or does it mean whatever people with power want it to mean at any given moment? The habitual labeling of Scalia as a âconservative,â as though he were simply using the Court to do what Jeff Sessions does in the Senate or Ken Buck does in the House, is a libel. As opposed to the       approach of the Courtâs Alice in Wonderland progressives, Scalia often reached decisions that annoyed conservative political activists  â   because the law demanded it. The Left complains that Scalia was an unthinking âfundamentalistâ on the Second Amendment, without taking a moment to consider that he approached the First Amendment in precisely the same way. When conservative legislators wanted to abridge   protections by passing a statute against flag burning, it was Scalia who stood in the way. EDITORIAL: Antonin Scalia, R. I. P.  â   Honor His Legacy as a Foe of Judicial Imperialism, The discussion surrounding Scalia and the fight over his replacement treats Scaliaâs philosophy  â   that the law says what it means and means what it says  â   as though it were exotic, or as if it were a quaint relic of some simpler age. But what is the alternative? Share article on FacebookshareTweet The alternative is to make the Supreme Court a   mob in a   society. We already are dangerously close to that point. No thinking person doubts that Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer will find a way to produce the outcome that the Left desires in any important case. Kagan lied to the Senate about her thinking on the question of gay marriage in order to have the opportunity to enact that thinking from the highest court. Never mind that the Constitution does not actually say what they wish it said about gay marriage, abortion, gun ownership, or the fact that First Amendment protections go well beyond the editorial board of the New York Times: If the Left demands a constitutional right to   abortion manufactured out of whole cloth, or that the words âthe right of the peopleâ be magically transformed into âthe National Guardâ in the case of the Second Amendment, these   justices will deliver. RELATED: Should the Senate Defer to the Presidentâs Supreme Court Picks? The Democrats introduced the contemporary approach to Supreme Court confirmation hearings  â   as partisan bar brawl  â   with the nomination of Robert Bork by President Ronald Reagan. In his famous, howlingly dishonest denunciation of the nominee, Senator Ted Kennedy proclaimed: The damage that President Reagan will do through this nomination, if it is not rejected by the Senate, could live on far beyond the end of his presidential term. President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to . . . impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and on the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice. More Supreme Court Legal Radicals Donât Want the âSeparation of Church and StateâBigotry against Religion Wonât Stop School Choice ForeverSCOTUS Delivers Win for Religious Liberty but Punts on School ChoiceThat isnât only the argument for stopping Barack Obama from replacing Scalia with a   activist today. And it isnât only an argument for voting against, filibustering, and otherwise trying to stop the nomination of   activists to the Supreme Court, and to other federal courts, as a general rule. If indeed Senator Kennedy was correct that the Senateâs duty is to prevent the president from imposing a defective view of the Constitution on future generations of Americans, then the Senateâs duty is to insist on nominees who share Scaliaâs view about the fundamental issue: That the law means what it says, and that it is not a writ for seers in black robes to pull out of the penumbras whatever suits them. By all means, send whatever bum Barack Obama puts forward back to his campus office with a swift kick in the pants. But that is only the beginning. Preventing further damage to the Court  â   and to the Constitution  â   in the here and now is necessary. Restoring the integrity of the Supreme Court, and reinvigorating faith in the rule of law for which it purportedly stands, will prove a long and difficult project.,","Mulvaney was likely parroting the   conservative belief that PBS  â   with cultural programming like Masterpiece Theater and Antiques Roadshow  â   is too highbrow, and geared solely towards âcoastal elites. â  Yet he may have seemed woefully out of touch with the needs and desires of economically struggling families to Vicenta Medina, an immigrant mother from Mexico. While she and her husband Gilbert struggled to raise their family on the South Side of Chicago forty years ago, she says Sesame Street helped teach English to their young son David. They watched him go on to collect degrees from both Harvard and the University of Chicago, and then work in the Obama White House â  where I first heard his story from a mutual friend. The Medinaâs story of a   family benefiting from public television is hardly anecdotal. Strong research shows that PBS programs such as Sesame Street have proven academic benefits for young audiences  â   especially those from more underprivileged households. According to a 2015 National Bureau of Economic Research study by University of Marylandâs Melissa Kearney and Wellesley Collegeâs Phillip Levine, exposure to Sesame Street is an extremely   intervention that has increased grade readiness for children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The effect is especially pronounced for boys and minority children, who have seen their likelihood of being below grade level decrease by as much as 16 percent. A number of earlier studies have also discovered positive academic impacts. One study found that children who watched Sesame Street frequently in   earned   grade point averages almost 16 percent higher than those of children who didnât grow up watching the show. Another from the University of Wisconsin concluded that children who watch international versions of the program gain nearly 12 percentile points on learning outcomes, as compared to those who donât watch the show. In Bangladesh,    viewers of the local version of Sesame Street were found to have 67 percent higher literacy scores, as compared to those who donât watch. And the benefits of programs like Sesame Street are not limited to academic achievement. A report from the Future of Children, a collaborative effort from Princeton University and the Brookings Institution, indicated that kids who watched Sesame Street formed more positive attitudes toward people from different backgrounds. That finding was replicated in Ireland, where exposure to the show promoted an increased propensity toward inclusiveness among   and   children. A study that examined Israeli and Palestinian children had similar conclusions. This is no small deal at a time when the country is seeing the number of hate incidents rising.   If there is an out of touch or elitist attitude toward PBS, it is the one implied by the OMB Director: The notion that lower income parents donât value this free educational television in the way suburban parents do, or that they and their families cannot appreciate the historical and educational documentaries that appear on PBS â  covering topics from Lewis and Clark to the Civil War to Jackie Robinson â  just doesnât match up with the facts. Surveys found that nearly   of poorer families reported that PBS KIDS âhelps a lotâ to prepare their children for school. PBS stations reach more kids ages two to five, more moms with young children, and more children from   families â  9 million in fact â  than any other kids TV network. And parents have confidence in PBS, with 66 percent saying they completely trust PBS KIDS to provide high quality programming â  thatâs 12 percent higher than the next closest competitor. The   proposed in the budget is a dubious one. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting cost the federal government just $445 million last year â  approximately one hundredth of one percent of the entire federal budget, and only about   of the $2. 8 billion in annual health care tax cuts the current Republican plan gives to the top 400 families alone â  a group with average incomes of $300 million. In a nation divided by inequality in income, schools, and neighborhoods, PBS is one equalizer â  providing all kids, regardless of economic background, the chance to watch and learn for free from the likes of Elmo, Bob the Builder, and the impressive show, Sid the Science Kid. Families with a lower household income report having fewer resources for school preparedness, and PBS can help fill that gap by providing free,   educational experiences.   It is difficult to imagine that the White House can defend the deep and painful cuts to programs that are vital to middle class and working poor families. But one way they canât defend the elimination of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is by suggesting that its efficacy lacks evidence, and has no support from working parents in   urban and rural areas who rely on this educational programming to improve their childrenâs future."

The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal, authored by Rep. Sean Maloney ( . Y.) appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a    vote. Outraged Democrats shouted âshameâ and accused Republican leaders of abusing chamber rules by holding the vote open until they could twist enough arms to kill the amendment.   How can a 2 min vote become an 8 min vote? When you need to work for 6 mins to keep discriminating vs #LGBT. Watch: https:  .   â   Jim Himes (@jahimes) May 19, 2016  âThey literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality,â Maloney said. âWe won this vote. â Maloney told reporters that when he saw House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) âpersonally twisting arms on the floor,â he asked him to let the vote conclude only to be told to âto get back on my own sideâ of the aisle. In protest, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( .) took to the microphone to rail against Republicans as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) walked around the Democratsâ side of the floor waving a red vote card and urging her members to vote no on the underlying military construction and veterans programs spending bill so that Republicans âget the message. â The spending bill subsequently was passed on a    vote, with 57 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. The House fracas comes as a national debate is underway over LGBT rights. The battle has reached a fever pitch in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a measure to ban transgender individuals from using a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. Corporations boycotted the state after the measure was enacted, and the federal government and North Carolina have now slapped competing lawsuits against each other. [North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights] Tensions over the issue in the House surfaced in recent weeks when a provision was added to the annual defense policy bill by Rep. Steve Russell ( .) that would exempt religious organizations that contract with the federal government from certain parts of civil rights law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Democrats and some moderate Republicans decried the proposal, but earlier this week GOP leaders blocked them from holding a vote to strip the language from the defense bill when it was on the floor. The battle then moved to Thursday when the chamber considered one of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which historically have been allowed to have a more   amendment process. The vote on Thursday is just one chapter in a fight that promises to occupy Congress in the coming weeks as both Republicans and Democrats plan further legislative measures to force the House to take a stand on the divide over whether certain policies, such as those concerning hiring practices and public bathrooms, amount to LGBT discrimination or protections for freedom of religion. When and where the fight will be waged remains murky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) on Thursday declined to say whether Republicans would bring up measures to curtail the Obama administrationâs efforts on LGBT rights, which include his recent directive to schools to accommodate transgender students in the bathrooms of their choosing. Ryan told reporters only that that such matters âshould be left up to the states. â But Ryan âis engaged in understandingâ how the House will try to push back on the transgender bathrooms issue, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( ) said. âWeâve encouraged him, Iâve encouraged him, heâs been encouraged,â he added. One option may be a new bill from Rep. Luke Messer ( .) which seeks to block President Obamaâs executive order on transgender bathrooms by preventing the administration from withholding federal funding from schools that donât comply with the order. Messer said Thursday he is looking for   vehicles as potential avenues for the legislation, such as appropriations bills. âI can assure you weâll try to do something in appropriations on this issue for sure,â said Rep. Tom Cole ( .) a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and a close ally of its chairman and the Speaker. According to a new   poll, the country is divided almost evenly with 46 percent of all people answering that transgender people should use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they were born and 41 percent believing they should use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify. There is a stark partisan divide, however:   of Republicans and 66 percent conservatives say that transgender people should use the restroom corresponding to their gender at birth, while 60 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of liberals say they should be able to use the restroom with which they identify. As Republicans cue up measures to push back on the presidentâs   orders, Democrats said to exploit any divisions within the GOP  â   or short of that, expose them. âThese things are going to be remembered,â Maloney said of the Republicans who switched their votes, likening the act to being on âthe wrong side of the march toward Selmaâ and âstanding in the schoolhouse doorâ to prevent the integration of schools. He said these lawmakers would âhave this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers. â"," The United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and the European Union have written to China to express concern over three new or planned laws, including one on counterterrorism, in a rare joint bid to pressure Beijing into taking their objections seriously. The U. S. Canadian, German and Japanese ambassadors signed a letter dated Jan. 27 addressed to State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun, voicing unease about the new counterterrorism law, the draft cyber security law, and a draft law on management of foreign   organizations (NGOs). In what sources said was a coordinated move, the ambassador of the European Union Delegation to China, Hans Dietmar Schweisgut, sent a letter expressing similar concerns, dated Jan. 28. Reuters reviewed copies of both letters. The cyber security and counterterrorism laws codify sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats, from widespread censorship to heightened control over certain technologies. Critics of the counterterrorism legislation, for one, say that it could be interpreted in such a way that even   dissidents could fall within its definition of terrorism. The four ambassadors said areas of the counterterrorism law, which the National Peopleâs Congress passed in December, were vague and could create a âclimate of uncertaintyâ among investors. They did not specify which areas. The EU ambassador used the same phrase to describe the lawâs impact, and both letters expressed an interest in engaging with China as it worked out implementing regulations around the law, to try to mitigate those concerns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, asked about the letters, said all countries were enhancing their efforts to combat terrorism, and that he hoped other countries would respect Chinaâs sovereignty. âThe counterterrorism law will not affect relevant businessesâ normal operations and it will not affect relevant personnelâs legitimate interests,â he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Guo could not be reached for comment. Chinaâs State Council Information Office and Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment. While countries often give feedback on proposed legislation in China, the rare joint response by several major powers, and coordination with the EU, signals an increased readiness to lend weight of numbers to their argument. It also points to growing frustration that the   individual approach taken in the past may not be working. âWhile we recognize the need for each country to address its security concerns, we believe the new legislative measures have the potential to impede commerce, stifle innovation, and infringe on Chinaâs obligation to protect human rights in accordance with international law,â said a   letter   by the four ambassadors. China has defended the new and draft laws, saying such steps, including heightened censorship, were necessary to ensure stability in the country of over 1. 3 billion people. âCLIMATE OF UNCERTAINTYâ The diplomatic push comes as Beijing arguably needs cooperation from the signatories to the letters more than ever. A slowing Chinese economy and fragile markets highlight the importance of foreign investorsâ confidence. Chinese companies are increasingly looking to get approvals from foreign governments for acquisitions, and the European Union is debating whether to give China âmarket economyâ status. On the draft cyber security law, all five ambassadors were particularly concerned by provisions requiring companies to store data locally and to provide encryption keys, which technology firms worried may impinge on privacy and mean they would have to pass on sensitive intellectual property to the government in the name of security. Both letters said the draft NGO management law had the potential to hinder academic exchanges and commercial activities, calling them âcrucial elementsâ of their relationships with China. Critics have said the draft legislation risked choking off NGOsâ work by requiring them to get official sponsors and giving broad powers to police to regulate their activities. In the letters, the ambassadors asked China to open both draft laws to another round of public consultations. The U. S. embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. A spokesman for the EU Delegation had no comment when reached by Reuters. The German embassy declined to comment on the letter. The Japanese embassy said: âWe pay attention to Chinese movement over relevant laws or drafts of laws.â  A Canadian government spokesperson said Canada had expressed its concerns to Chinaâs government âabout a number of new laws and regulations that constrain civil society and hinder access to information. âWe have expressed these concerns through a variety of different approaches and will continue to raise these with the Chinese government,â the spokesperson added. The parties to the letters decided to express their concerns together after it became unclear to what degree China was taking their individual input on the laws on board, said a person with knowledge of the matter. âWeâre trying to avoid the divide and conquer approach (by China). They like to do that on any possible occasion. We wanted to send a   that when we have shared interests, we cannot so easily be split,â the person said, adding that there had been no clear response by China so far to the letters. âWe donât plan to establish a   relationship. We want something to happen.â  (Additional reporting by Michael Martina, Megha Rajagopalan and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Mike  ) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a âdeclaration of warâ which could trigger clashes within days. WASHINGTON U. S. President Donald Trump will get a chance to patch up   ties this week when he meets with NATO allies still rattled by his failure on an earlier trip to embrace the principle that an attack against one member is an attack against all. ","Donald Trumpâs campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trumpâs use of funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts, telling CNNâs Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesnât take money as a salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trumpâs to give away. âYou know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trumpâs money,â Conway said, neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation since 2008. âThe Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in. â Donald Trumpâs campaign manager has only the utmost respect for former president George HW Bush, whose age she mentioned casually while discussing his alleged plan to vote for Hillary Clinton: Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that âour   communities are in the worst shape theyâve ever been . .. Ever. Ever. Ever. â The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage. A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. âImmigration security is national security,â he said, and repeatedly read the lyrics of the The Snake, a 1960s soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the consequences of the United States taking in refugees. The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as âthe vessel for all the global special interests seeking to run our livesâ and said that the âfailed political establishmentâ had âvestedâ in her âall of their money, all of their hopes for another generation of corruptionâ. Trump also argued that the âdishonest mediaâ had âbled this country dryâ. But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that the billionaire converted $258, 000 in donations to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that could potentially even force the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by bragging on Tuesday about spending âOPM  â   other peopleâs moneyâ. Texas senator and former presidential contender Ted Cruz declined to say if he plans to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, again: Donald Trump called for a more rigorous immigration policy following the arrest of an American man born in Afghanistan for bombing attacks in New York and New Jersey this weekend. The Republican presidential nominee spoke to supporters at High Point University in North Carolina today and reiterated his vow to build a wall on the   border. Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâs campaign has filed its September Federal Election Commission report for the month of August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic parties, from more than 1. 1 million contributions, with an average contribution of $50. The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank. âThe millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot,â campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. âWith voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to vote. â More than 60% of the campaignâs August contributions were from women, and roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200. The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began August. Donald Trumpâs latest comments maybe needs a  : Our African American communities are in the worse shape theyâve ever been. Ever. Ever. Ever. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, itâs relevant reading:  I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America. Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?â But in America, people said: âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you become a citizen?â America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable. With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow Americaâs example and work together to do more to support refugees. ... When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, itâs important that President Obama is setting this example. When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country. Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again. Fox News talking head Sean Hannityâs outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an   promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance. Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to soak up each othersâ awesomeness, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee: One of the reasons Iâm supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, heâs going to put originalists on the supreme court   people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers,   branches of government. Heâs a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe. And, of course, heâs gonna build that wall. He says heâs gonna have Mexico pay for it. Thatâs fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we donât want people competing for jobs. He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us  . And as somebody whoâs been a marksman since Iâm 11 years old, protecting our Second Amendment rights are paramount to me. The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds. On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  â   the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of Robert F Kennedy  â   that he plans to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, CNN is reporting that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponentâs spouse: Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to Bush   an extraordinary rebuke of his own partyâs nominee.  Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former presidentâs plans on 8 November. âThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,â Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. âHe is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. â The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans spend talking about   racial metaphors that were once used by Nazi war criminals, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a âtremendous asset to the campaign. â Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump campaign, the Republican nomineeâs communications team has elected to double down on the statement. âDon Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,â wrote communications advisor Jason Miller in a statement. âAmerica has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clintonâs planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do whatâs needed to protect us. â The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir William Eden   used a very similar metaphor in an address to Parliament: Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that partook of it. The Nevada Republican party seems eager to focus on   races this year. .. Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to Buzzfeed News, but the    candidateâs campaign is still breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the movements of the Republican nominee. Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trumpâs motorcade, a break in   tradition that the campaign originally promised to maintain. âWe have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,â Trumpâs pool reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. âWe have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on Trumpâs plane so it is a truly protective pool. They have not been responsive to that request. â The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his campaign plane, instead opting for a âchaserâ plane that had led to delays for reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. (Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in time.)"

The protesters who occupied Maidan, as the square is known, prepared for battle, stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013, after the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response, tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance.As the months passed, confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There, I photographed the fighters against a black curtain, a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire, ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here, I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history. With this realization, I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men, with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word ""costume"" because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment, irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves, this outward expression of masculinity, the ideal of the warrior.I worked slowly, using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old-fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February 20, which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers, loyal to the government, started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all, three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly, but celebration remained elusive in Maidan.As the days passed in Kiev's central square, streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people, filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before.I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day, my fixer, Emine, and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats, their shiny handbags, and the bunches of red carnations, white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there.It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are â not the way we look, but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict, not only in Maidan, and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior, then the women showed the implications of such violence.When I made these pictures, I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today, the death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan, the barricades have been dismantled, and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced, so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters, the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims, ""Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes."" Thank you. (Applause).","When we think of Nepal, we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas, the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes, or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills, where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener, there lives a great diversity of wildlife, including the one-horned rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately, these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals, battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks, but that is not an easy task, because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife.Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime, and these are drones, or more specifically, conservation drones. For about a year now, my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape, but it also allows you to capture detailed, high-resolution images of objects on the ground. This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential, not only for combating wildlife crime, but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations.So what is a drone? Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload, such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go.Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone, but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is, a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars.So now that you've built your own conservation drone, you probably want to go fly it, but how does one fly a drone? Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.So what can we do with a conservation drone? Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example, camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests, but these are motion-activated cameras, so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images, and that takes a lot of time, especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fiâenabled cameras.Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous, because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna, not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest.A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests.And finally, I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications.Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe, strongly believe, that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way, they are right. I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time, we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool, including drones, in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet.Thank you.(Applause)","(Music)Good afternoon.As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden.This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me: a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start, because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons, and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light. All of them are different colors, they're rippling with different frequencies, and they're bouncing off every surface, including me, and some of those are flying directly into your eyes, and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.Now a laser is different. It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye, you can use it to store massive amounts of data, and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent, but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency, an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero.Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction, so if you were to take the lid off that bottle, it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall, flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment, and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree, it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science: the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.But the experiment is not the end of the story, because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment, it seemed like the more he said, the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea, to really capture its essence, the fewer words you use, the better. In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking, my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words, scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly, it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for ""Dance Your Ph.D."" There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example, at the University of Minnesota, there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde, and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside, because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers, and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab, but before he does that, he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming, and when I visited David to learn about his research, he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy.(Laughter) (Applause)Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course, but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day. Now that assumes half-hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of 35,000 dollars, and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time, and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day, that would indeed add up to an annual waste of 100 billion dollars. Of course, that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool, and like any tool, it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA, it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence, the illusion of simplicity, and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example, our National Endowment for the Arts, with its $150 million budget, slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one-thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts, there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution, and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists, let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers. After all, they are the most perishable of their kind, prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds, we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help.Of course someday, in the deep future, a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented, rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However, I trust that by that day, we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. (Music) (Applause)"

 on 19 Dec. 2015 // The car is much heavier than expected which gives it a nice weight and the wheels and paint finish are very well done. I love the size of it too.I bought this a present for someone else but as others reported that theirs arrived broken, so I opened it when it arrived and found one of the head lamps broken off and missing. It's not in the box so it must have been packed like that, which means I'm going to have to give someone a present that is not complete which sucks. And the stripes down the sides feel very flimsy and you can tell that they are going to break off quickly even with careful handling.Such a weird combination of quality and cheap finishes.As others have said, for the cost you would expect the doors to open at the very least. Or have the boys weapons on the seat, something that made it obvious that it was from the show and not just a regular Impala. With just a tiny bit more effort, this could have been a fantastic product. If they remade this product with those features I would buy one for myself in a heartbeat. | looks Great,  lacking in detail though ! // 4.0 // 20 Nov. 2014 // By

Even when using an agile approach, there's still a need to forecast over a long time period. The challenge is to combine both a long-term vision and frequent, continuous delivery along the way. We tend to find that a lot of teams using JIRA are actually tracking and strategic goals in disconnected tools like spreadsheets, which can be quite painful and time consuming! So today I'm going to show you how our resident experts on planning, the JIRA Portfolio team, use JIRA Portfolio to combine long-term planning and agile development. Let's see how the team does it - are you ready to jump into some planning? Start with the big picture Every quarter, the JIRA Portfolio team does a full roadmap review and planning, along with reviewing and updating objectives and key results. To start off, the team first defines the strategic themes for the roadmap by answering general questions like, "" where are we going? "" and "" where should we be spending our time "" (note that they don't focus on questions like "" what specific features do we want to build "" ). Techniques for coming up with this high-level product strategy could fill a separate blog post, but it roughly involves reviewing customer suggestions on jira.atlassian.com , customer interview notes, and feedback from teams within Atlassian to identify structural gaps (the combination of these two are used to identify recurring/common/structural problems), as well as reviewing advancements in the market and the strategic goals of the the wider organization. The two dominant themes that came out of the latest planning session for the JIRA Portfolio roadmap ""Integrated planning"" (think a tighter integration with JIRA and JIRA Agile) and ""PPM at scale"" (think views and reports across multiple plans). There were lots of other themes, of course, but these two are the priorities and where the team decided they would devote most of their time. ProTip : Prepare to iterate! Distilling a roadmap to 3-5 crisp focus areas is hard! The team typically knows the outcome is good if the themes feel like ""stating the obvious,"" and the general response from peers is ""well, of course that's what you need to focus on... what else would make sense?"" Identify the big-ticket items Once the themes were decided on as a team (and, of course, backed by clearly-defined goals and success metrics), the Product Manager entered them into JIRA Portfolio. The team then got together again to think about what actually needed to be done in order to accomplish these themes, answering questions like ""what big chunks of work do we need to get done in order to deliver on this theme?"" or""what needs to happen in order to ensure that gets delivered?"" For example, when they sat down to see what they needed to accomplish for the theme ""Integrated planning,"" it resulted in things like ""simplified data management"" and ""live planning and snapshots."" . Note that while several initiatives are specific to the JIRA Portfolio team, there are also initiatives shared with and mostly driven by other teams inside Atlassian. For example, a new feature in the JIRA platform might require the JIRA Portfolio team to integrate with this new functionality. Get all the data in one place the time consuming but well worth the work. Those ""big chunks of work"" mentioned earlier, i.e. initiatives, now needed to be broken down into more consumable pieces, so it was time to . This was done as a combination of: Breaking down initiatives into new epics and stories : Brainstorming between product management, engineering, and UX designers, to slice out tangible and incrementally shippable pieces of work. This was done inside JIRA Portfolio, and once the epics and stories were ready for implementation, they were turned into actual JIRA issues. Importing existing issues : The Product Manager also imported all of the relevant epics and stories that already existed in JIRA such as customer suggestions gathered on jira.atlassian.com and assigned them to the right initiatives. ProTip : When importing a big amount of existing, un-estimated issues, it isn't necessary to estimate all of them individually. JIRA Portfolio allows you to enter a default estimate for both epics and stories. Taking an average value of past stories is usually sufficient for a rough plan, as long as the plan is then constantly updated and refined along the way. Gathering and grooming the backlog is definitely the most time consuming part - getting data from potentially multiple different JIRA projects and then assigning epics to the initiatives they set earlier. Once this is done, however, the result is an awesome global overview, with aggregated progress and status across initiatives and it is super easy to dive into planning. JIRA Portfolio Cloud recently launched (yay! ï¿½ï¿½ ) so the below shows you how the team tracked progress and status for this initiative. Time to start planning The JIRA Portfolio team uses story points for estimation, so the Product Manager just grabbed the team's velocity straight from the Agile Board. The team is actually growing so they have split work into two streams: JP Core (continuous improvement on version 1.x) and JP2 (fundamental changes towards 2.x). See the roadmap for the first time So, JIRA Portfolio took all of the team's planning and calculated a realistic schedule for the (yes, the dates in the schedule are blank to spur imagination). The schedule below is set to the initiatives view to see the projected start and end dates of each initiative. Play with ""what-if"" scenarios Now with roadmap done (or at least ""visible at last""), the team was in full planning mode! With all the data in place, the Product Manager and Development Manager in collaboration with program management, began to move around variables like earlier release dates, scope changes, feature date adjustments, and people planning. Trying different planning scenarios was especially important as the team was determining whether to add the functionality of cost planning and reporting into the scope of their 2.x release. Because the team had all of the data in , they were able to model these what-if scenarios and instantly see the impact a possible change might have on the future. This is also a great way to communicate openly with stakeholders and clearly point out the tradeoffs. See how reality lines up with goals It was now time to head back and look at those themes we spoke about earlier. So much planning and scoping had happened since then and the team was interested to see if the detailed plan matched the high-level targets for investment allocation. Thankfully, the plan looked quite balanced! ""Integrated planning"" was slightly underfunded relative to the target, as the plan contained more work on UX improvements and convenience functions. However, it was easy for the Product Manager and Development Manager to jump back into the the schedule and backlog to see what was driving this and how they could adjust. Put the plan to action As mentioned earlier, the team creates a lot of epics and stories directly in . Once the plan is done, they then create these epics and stories in bulk so that the team can actually work on the issue in JIRA and JIRA Agile. The team tries to keep the backlog on the agile board short and easily manageable, and typically only creates issues from the plan prior to the planning meeting for the next sprint. For any upcoming sprint, the relevant issues can be directly created from the schedule view. Ensure the plan is up to date The JIRA Portfolio team does these planning sessions quarterly, however, the plan is still updated after each sprint There are two key activities the Product Manager does after each sprint to keep the plan up-to-date: A to re-baseline with what has actually been done (which issues have been resolved, how much is remaining if still open). If new stories have been added somewhere in JIRA (either a scope change, or an epic has been broken down into detailed stories), the Product Manager imports these into JIRA Portfolio to check the impact on the plan. Share, discuss, communicate So what did the team do with this living, breathing plan? They shared it! plan at Atlassian so everyone is kept up to date and on the same page with what the plans are. that they have set up in the JIRA Portfolio space. It's great to share information with the whole team and to interactively play through planning scenarios! And thats a wrap! We know that's a lot to take in, so if you want more info, some live demos and the chance for Q&A, join Martin Suntinger, Principal Product Manager for JIRA Portfolio, in the next JIRA Portfolio webinar. to know how you're using JIRA Portfolio so tell us in the comments below!

The grilled one is not moist that makes the lobster meat a little bit dry. And for the burger, I would rather have a burger somewhere else. The butter garlic sauce is unbeatable I asked for a second one every time. Just to avoid lunch and dinner time as it doesn't worth to queue that long for this. Tips: The one in Harvey Nichols has the shortest queue and most of the time none.",Went here one night with no reservatio n but we were welcomed and the food was amazing. Has an open kitchen and a good wine list. Friendly and generous waiters.,"We visited on a busy Saturday and should have booked as the restaurant was packed. We were prepared to wait and the staff did their very best to find us a table, and fortunately after a while we were shown downstairs to a comfortable banquette, and again met Irvine a friendly and efficient waiter from Mexico who for his sins has married an English girl.We had a set 2 course meal with a couple of glasses of red plus coffees which came to around Â£35 with a tip. We both had steak but I had a starter of rillettes de porc whilst the memsahib had a Greek salad with feta cheese - both were excellent as were the steaks. I saw a plate of creamed spinach going to another table and wished that we had also ordered a portion, but the whole meal was very good value.The set meals are great value but we must go back some time and spend more money for some moules along with a sirloin steak and a bottle of red, even if it means that I fall asleep at the matinee in the afternoon."

These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income.

National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies.

Almost all national poverty lines are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. The data is based on the two most recent years for which survey data are available.

Survey year is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which most of the data were collected.","Separate national poverty lines are often constructed for the rural and urban areas of a country.

            that information.",Credit and debit card numbers were stolen using bogus checkout-line card readers resulting in card numbers processed at those terminals being captured and some to be misused.

Republican Bill Brief for: House Sub. SB42 

Date Passed Committee: 03/13/17 

 
 Bill Brief Author:  Rep. Jennings 
  
Sponsored by:  House Corrections & Juvenile Justice Committee 
 
A Bill Concerning:   Juvenile Offenders â Trailer Bill to 2016 SB 367 
 
What Bill Does:   This legislation makes changes to the juvenile offender code as revised in the 2016 session of 
the legislature through passage of SB 367. The original bill, HB 2466, contained one provision that altered the 
possible penalties for the use of a firearm during the commission of an offense by a juvenile.  HB 2466 bill was 
amended in committee and the contents of the amended bill were inserted into SB42.  The bill does the 
following: 
 

1.   Establishes a special sentencing rule for offenses where the juvenile uses a firearm in the commission of 
the offense.  The special sentencing rule will provide that upon a finding of the trier of fact that a firearm 
was used by the offender, the offender may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a 
minimum term of six months and a maximum term of 18 months regardless of whether the underlying 
offense committed would be an offense for which commitment to a correctional facility would otherwise 
be available. 

2.  Requires the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain a statewide searchable database that 

contains information regarding juvenile participation in immediate intervention programs.  Access to the 
database will be required to include county and district attorneys, judges, community supervision 
officers and juvenile intake and assessment officers.  

3.  Provides that when a juvenile offender absconds from supervision the act of absconding does not 

constitute a âtechnical violationâ of the conditions of supervision and upon reasonable efforts to locate 
the juvenile a warrant may be issued by the court. Current law requires three technical violations of 
supervision before revocation can occur.  Probation term limits and overall case length limits shall be 
tolled during the period that the offender absconded. 

4.  Defines the point in time in the proceeding of a juvenile offender case upon which the counting of days 

towards the imposed detention limitation of 45 days is calculated.  The count of detention days will 
commence upon disposition (sentencing) or 15 days following adjudication, whichever is sooner. 

5.  Changes the current limitation of 3 months to the total case time limit when removal of the offender 

from the home is necessary because the victim of a sex offense normally resides in the same residence as 
the offender. 

6.  Renames the juvenile justice improvement fund to the evidence-based program account of the state 
general fund and provides the Secretary of Corrections the ability to transfer funds projected to be 
available as a result of savings generated by juvenile justice reform when identified rather than the 
current method of annual transfer at the conclusion of the fiscal year.  Funds deposited in the evidence-
based program account remain out of reach for allotment by the Governor and are limited in their use for 
community programs and no other governmental purpose. 

7.  Incorporates identical language as found in the Code for Care of Children regarding specific findings 

with respect to reasonable efforts having been taken to avoid the out of home placement.  These findings 
are required to be made by the court upon an initial out of home placement in order to assure eligibility 
for federal IV -E support for juvenile offenders when placed out of home.  These findings in no way 

modify the findings required to be made by the court with respect to the initial order of out of home 
placement and only serve to supplement those findings in order to protect the interest of the state in 
assuring the highest level of federal funding available. 

8.  A technical change to eliminate duplicative language regarding required family reintegration efforts of 
the Department of Children and Family Services when a Child in Need of Care proceeding is ongoing 
during the term of a juvenile offender proceeding or dispositional case length limit period. 

9.  Changes the number, membership and role of the Kansas Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee.  The 

number of members is increased from 19 to 21.  The two additional members include one member 
appointed by the Chair of the Kansas Advisory Group (KAG) on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention from the youth membership of the KAG. The second additional member is a detention center 
director appointed by the Attorney General. The duties of the committee are expanded to include 
creating a plan to address the mental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system and review the 
collaborative work of the Department of Corrections and the Office of Judicial Administration and make 
recommendations when there is not consensus between the two.  

10. Includes certain modifications to the law pertaining to Immediate Intervention Programs (IIP) (formerly 

known as diversion agreements) 

a.  Provides that permitting participation in an IIP for a misdemeanor sex offense is within the 

discretion of the prosecutor and not automatically available to the offender. 

b.  In the case of a juvenile who is originally charged with a felony offense and a plea agreement is 

reached for a plea to a misdemeanor, the offender is not automatically entitled to an IIP if the 
offense constitutes a first-time misdemeanor offense.  Participation in an IIP would be within the 
discretion of the prosecutor. 

c.  The prosecutor may exclude an offender from mandatory participation in an IIP when the 

prosecutor declines prosecution. 

d.  Mandatory availability of an IIP for a misdemeanor offense will apply only to the first event of a 

misdemeanor violation.  Second or subsequent instances of misdemeanor violations, when the 
offender has previously participated in an IIP, the prosecutor will have discretion to permit 
additional instances of participation in an IIP.  

11.  Amends the placement matrix statute (version effective July 1, 2017) to consolidate the categories of 

serious offender III and serious offender IV, which carry the same risk-level requirements and JCF 
commitment terms, into a single serious offender III category. 

 
Political Reality/Implications:   Affords prosecutors and judges greater discretion in certain circumstances, 
holds youth accountable for their behavior in ways appropriate to their developmental stage and enhances 
public safety through providing evidence-based interventions within the community that change behavior of 
offending youth. 
 
Committee Amendments:   Yes 
 
Possible Floor Amendments:  Yes - but none known now. 
 
*Conferees:    Benet Magnuson, Kansas Appleseed â Recommended against changes to SB367, advocated for 
expansion of oversight responsibility regarding mental health needs of youth, disabled youth and minority 
youth. Parental presence for all interrogations of youth under 18. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amy Raymond, Kansas Judicial Branch â Permit parallel development, adoption and

KDOC administrative regulation.  Delay section 1 of SB 367 until July 1, 2017 as deadline has passed but work 
is expected to be complete by July 1, 2017.  Provide for immunity of court service officers in calculation 
program credits that lead to early termination of supervision.  Allow time for review of YLS scores sufficient to 
test and validate prior to implementation.  Use of standard YLS cutoff scores during the interim period. 
 
45 day detention limit in cases.  Restore danger to self language to permit detention.  Provide for issuance of 
warrant/override limitation on issuance of warrant for technical probation violation. 
David McKune â Provide for parental notification and presence when youth interrogated and 
 
regarding youth questioning for possible school suspension issue. Delay fingerprinting and photographs until 
after adjudication.  Improved training regarding interrogation.  De-criminalize minor law violations in school â 
treat as disciplinary matters. 
Don Hymer, Kansas County and District Attorneys Association â Restore former sentencing 
 
matrix. Concern about drive by shootings and other level 7 felony offenses. Allow up to 90 days in detention as 
a sentencing alternate for misdemeanors.  Extend total case length limits for community supervision.  Restore 
extended juvenile jurisdiction prosecution and other provisions for waiver to adult court as existed prior to 
SB367.  Eliminate SB367 memorandum of agreement regarding school-based offenses.  Eliminate detention 
risk assessment requirement prior to detention hearing. IIP changes to restore prosecutor control exclusively. 
Eliminate multi-disciplinary team requirement.  Allow for detention while on probation, on house arrest and 
safety of offender is at risk.  Restore harm to self as basis for detention placement. 
 
adherence to use of data-driven and research based.  Use oversight committee. 
 
concern about use of funds for IIP data system. 
 
about funding stability and staff training.  Supports items discussed in meetings that illustrated changes

*Note:  The process method used to construct the bill was not particularly conducive for conferees to indicate 
status as a proponent, opponent or neutral.  All presenting are being reported as a conferee. A brief summary of 
their position is provided.  Their full written testimony is available on the legislative website under the 
Correction and Juvenile Justice Committee minutes tab.  
 
Fiscal Note:   No fiscal implications outside of agency existing resources.  Incremental expense in an unknown 
amount may be incurred because of the IIP database requirement.  However, it is contemplated this component 
of data may be added to an existing information management system program without significant expense.  
Some lost savings as a result of expanding the offenses in which a firearm is used to allow for juvenile 
correctional facility commitment may occur.
