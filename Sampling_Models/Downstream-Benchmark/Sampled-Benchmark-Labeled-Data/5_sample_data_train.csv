While Bernie Sanders assured cheering supporters at a Los Angeles rally overnight that he plans to keep fighting, Fox News confirmed that the presidential candidate plans to lay off âover halfâ his staff in the next week.  And the math  â   which even he acknowledged  â   does not look good. Clinton pocketed a victory in California, the biggest prize of the night and a state Sanders had fought hard to win. All told, Clinton is projected to win an outright majority of pledged delegates, while reaching the 2, 383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from   âsuperdelegatesâ  â   party officials who can support any candidate they want.  Sanders all along has challenged the legitimacy of those insiders, but at this stage he would need to convince the lionâs share of Clinton superdelegates to abandon her to deny her the nomination on the convention floor, a virtually unprecedented feat. While his supporters egged him on and could be heard booing at the mere mention of Clinton during his early morning rally, his position in the race at this stage would appear to leave them in limbo  â   backing a candidate whose path to the nomination has all but vanished.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â Still, Sanders pledged to campaign through the finale primary Tuesday in Washington, D. C. and go on to the Democratic convention. He vowed to âtake our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. â In a potential move toward reconciliation, the White House revealed that President Obama called both Clinton and Sanders Tuesday night  â   and plans to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday, to discuss âhow to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters.â Clinton earlier claimed victory over Sanders  â   after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win  â   during a lofty speech to supporters in Brooklyn. âThanks to you, weâve reached a milestone,â Clinton declared, upon becoming the first woman in American history to top the ticket of a major political party.  Marking the historic moment, Clinton said: âThis campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits on any of us. â She also congratulated Sanders, calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party  â   while also saying this is a moment to âcome together. â Sandersâ vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Clintonâs superdelegates to force a contested convention. They do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month. Pledged delegates, however, are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucus. Fox News projects that Clinton will still have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention    making it more difficult for Sanders to argue sheâs winning only because of support from superdelegates. Sanders did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakotaâs Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary. A total of six states were voting Tuesday Clinton won the rest. On the GOP side, Donald Trump    the only major Republican left in the race  â   was projected to win the primaries in California, Montana, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico. Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night, winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nomination. Marking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. Trump said: âTonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. â Previewing the general election battle, he slammed the Clintons, alleging they âturned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. â He also appealed to Sanders supporters, saying, âWe welcome you with open arms. â Clinton, in her victory speech, also took shots at Trump, claiming he would âtake America backwards. â âThe stakes in this election are high, and the choice is clear. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president,â she said. The Democratic Party pressure on Sanders, meanwhile, is sure to mount in a matter of days, if not hours. Obama reportedly is planning to get behind Clinton and start campaigning for her, and senior Democrats have been voicing mounting frustration with Sandersâ campaign. At the same time, the senator has touted general election polls suggesting he may be better positioned to go up against Trump in the fall.    ","At its best, the Supreme Court functions precisely as it was intended: as an antidemocratic brake on popular legislative and presidential passions when those passions do violence to the law, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. At its worst  â   and it often has been at its worst of late  â   it functions like Iranâs Guardian Council, a collection of   faqihs and jurists that sits above and outside the political process, using its position and privilege to impose on the nation a narrow set of social values decocted from the political ether. With the death of Antonin Scalia and the prospect of replacing him, we are faced once again with the question: Does the law mean what it says, or does it mean whatever people with power want it to mean at any given moment? The habitual labeling of Scalia as a âconservative,â as though he were simply using the Court to do what Jeff Sessions does in the Senate or Ken Buck does in the House, is a libel. As opposed to the       approach of the Courtâs Alice in Wonderland progressives, Scalia often reached decisions that annoyed conservative political activists  â   because the law demanded it. The Left complains that Scalia was an unthinking âfundamentalistâ on the Second Amendment, without taking a moment to consider that he approached the First Amendment in precisely the same way. When conservative legislators wanted to abridge   protections by passing a statute against flag burning, it was Scalia who stood in the way. EDITORIAL: Antonin Scalia, R. I. P.  â   Honor His Legacy as a Foe of Judicial Imperialism, The discussion surrounding Scalia and the fight over his replacement treats Scaliaâs philosophy  â   that the law says what it means and means what it says  â   as though it were exotic, or as if it were a quaint relic of some simpler age. But what is the alternative? Share article on FacebookshareTweet The alternative is to make the Supreme Court a   mob in a   society. We already are dangerously close to that point. No thinking person doubts that Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer will find a way to produce the outcome that the Left desires in any important case. Kagan lied to the Senate about her thinking on the question of gay marriage in order to have the opportunity to enact that thinking from the highest court. Never mind that the Constitution does not actually say what they wish it said about gay marriage, abortion, gun ownership, or the fact that First Amendment protections go well beyond the editorial board of the New York Times: If the Left demands a constitutional right to   abortion manufactured out of whole cloth, or that the words âthe right of the peopleâ be magically transformed into âthe National Guardâ in the case of the Second Amendment, these   justices will deliver. RELATED: Should the Senate Defer to the Presidentâs Supreme Court Picks? The Democrats introduced the contemporary approach to Supreme Court confirmation hearings  â   as partisan bar brawl  â   with the nomination of Robert Bork by President Ronald Reagan. In his famous, howlingly dishonest denunciation of the nominee, Senator Ted Kennedy proclaimed: The damage that President Reagan will do through this nomination, if it is not rejected by the Senate, could live on far beyond the end of his presidential term. President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to . . . impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and on the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.

And it isnât only an argument for voting against, filibustering, and otherwise trying to stop the nomination of   activists to the Supreme Court, and to other federal courts, as a general rule. If indeed Senator Kennedy was correct that the Senateâs duty is to prevent the president from imposing a defective view of the Constitution on future generations of Americans, then the Senateâs duty is to insist on nominees who share Scaliaâs view about the fundamental issue: That the law means what it says, and that it is not a writ for seers in black robes to pull out of the penumbras whatever suits them. By all means, send whatever bum Barack Obama puts forward back to his campus office with a swift kick in the pants. But that is only the beginning. Preventing further damage to the Court  â   and to the Constitution  â   in the here and now is necessary. Restoring the integrity of the Supreme Court, and reinvigorating faith in the rule of law for which it purportedly stands, will prove a long and difficult project.,","Mulvaney was likely parroting the   conservative belief that PBS  â   with cultural programming like Masterpiece Theater and Antiques Roadshow  â   is too highbrow, and geared solely towards âcoastal elites. â  Yet he may have seemed woefully out of touch with the needs and desires of economically struggling families to Vicenta Medina, an immigrant mother from Mexico. While she and her husband Gilbert struggled to raise their family on the South Side of Chicago forty years ago, she says Sesame Street helped teach English to their young son David. They watched him go on to collect degrees from both Harvard and the University of Chicago, and then work in the Obama White House â  where I first heard his story from a mutual friend. The Medinaâs story of a   family benefiting from public television is hardly anecdotal. Strong research shows that PBS programs such as Sesame Street have proven academic benefits for young audiences  â   especially those from more underprivileged households. According to a 2015 National Bureau of Economic Research study by University of Marylandâs Melissa Kearney and Wellesley Collegeâs Phillip Levine, exposure to Sesame Street is an extremely   intervention that has increased grade readiness for children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The effect is especially pronounced for boys and minority children, who have seen their likelihood of being below grade level decrease by as much as 16 percent. A number of earlier studies have also discovered positive academic impacts. One study found that children who watched Sesame Street frequently in   earned   grade point averages almost 16 percent higher than those of children who didnât grow up watching the show. Another from the University of Wisconsin concluded that children who watch international versions of the program gain nearly 12 percentile points on learning outcomes, as compared to those who donât watch the show. In Bangladesh,    viewers of the local version of Sesame Street were found to have 67 percent higher literacy scores, as compared to those who donât watch. And the benefits of programs like Sesame Street are not limited to academic achievement. A report from the Future of Children, a collaborative effort from Princeton University and the Brookings Institution, indicated that kids who watched Sesame Street formed more positive attitudes toward people from different backgrounds. That finding was replicated in Ireland, where exposure to the show promoted an increased propensity toward inclusiveness among   and   children. A study that examined Israeli and Palestinian children had similar conclusions. This is no small deal at a time when the country is seeing the number of hate incidents rising.   If there is an out of touch or elitist attitude toward PBS, it is the one implied by the OMB Director: The notion that lower income parents donât value this free educational television in the way suburban parents do, or that they and their families cannot appreciate the historical and educational documentaries that appear on PBS â  covering topics from Lewis and Clark to the Civil War to Jackie Robinson â  just doesnât match up with the facts. Surveys found that nearly   of poorer families reported that PBS KIDS âhelps a lotâ to prepare their children for school. PBS stations reach more kids ages two to five, more moms with young children, and more children from   families â  9 million in fact â  than any other kids TV network. And parents have confidence in PBS, with 66 percent saying they completely trust PBS KIDS to provide high quality programming â  thatâs 12 percent higher than the next closest competitor. The   proposed in the budget is a dubious one. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting cost the federal government just $445 million last year â  approximately one hundredth of one percent of the entire federal budget, and only about   of the $2. 8 billion in annual health care tax cuts the current Republican plan gives to the top 400 families alone â  a group with average incomes of $300 million. In a nation divided by inequality in income, schools, and neighborhoods, PBS is one equalizer â  providing all kids, regardless of economic background, the chance to watch and learn for free from the likes of Elmo, Bob the Builder, and the impressive show, Sid the Science Kid. Families with a lower household income report having fewer resources for school preparedness, and PBS can help fill that gap by providing free,   educational experiences.   It is difficult to imagine that the White House can defend the deep and painful cuts to programs that are vital to middle class and working poor families. But one way they canât defend the elimination of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is by suggesting that its efficacy lacks evidence, and has no support from working parents in   urban and rural areas who rely on this educational programming to improve their childrenâs future.",", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Finlandâs tax authorities have demanded a national broadcaster hand over information related to the Panama Paper leaks or be subject to search warrants for its newsroom and its journalistsâ homes, the broadcaster, Yle, said. Yle said the Finnish Tax Administration set an April 29 deadline to receive information, but the broadcaster has refused to share anything, citing journalist ethics and the need to protect source confidentiality. Yle, which is mostly state owned, will appeal to the nationâs judiciary, its lawyer said Monday. Yle journalists were among the 400 reporters in 80 countries who spent a year combing through the 11 million documents first obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. In an   last week, Marit af BjÃ¶rkesten, the director of Yleâs Swedish division, and Ville VilÃ©n, Yleâs creative director, explained why Yle would fight the tax agencyâs request: If out of a network of 400 journalists participating in the project, Finnish journalists alone were to hand over any information to a third party, Yleâs access to the material would presumably be immediately be revoked. We could no doubt live with this. What would be more serious is that Yleâs actions would jeopardise the chances of Finnish journalists participating in international investigative networks. Who would involve a journalist from a country where there is a risk that officials can demand  â   and receive  â   confidential information? How reliable would others consider an organisation that officials could barge into to confiscate files? Could Finns themselves ever rely on journalists to protect their sources? The Panama Papers leak revealed last month the secret offshore companies of dozens of wealthy individuals in more than 50 countries. In Finland, hundreds of people, ranging from entrepreneurs and athletes to convicted felons, were named in the documents, pulled from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama. The financial activities are not necessarily illegal, but offshore companies can be exploited to allow their owners to conceal their assets from their native governmentâs tax authorities. When the first news reports on the leak emerged, Finlandâs finance minister, Alexander Stubb, said, âNow it is up to the police and other authorities to evaluate whether illegalities have taken place involving Finns. â Last week, Stubb said âthereâs nothingâ his office could do about the    over the information, calling it âan issue between Yle and the tax authorities. â             Like this?

Please follow the steps below, East Lansing, Michigan, becomes a ghost town during spring break. Families head south, often to the theme parks in Orlando. A week later, the Midwesterners return sunburned and bereft of disposable income, and, urological surgeon David Wartinger noticed, some also come home with fewer kidney stones. Wartinger is a professor emeritus at Michigan State, where he has dealt for decades with the scourge of kidney stones, which affect around one in 10 people at some point in life. Most are small, and they pass through us without issue. But many linger in our kidneys and grow, sending hundreds of thousands of people to emergency rooms and costing around $3. 8 billion every year in treatment and extraction. The pain of passing a larger stone is often compared to child birth. For years in practice, Wartinger noticed anecdotal reports from patients who had passed small kidney stones during and immediately after visiting the Disney theme parks. It was a correlation he might not have noticed in another place, he told me: âThis mass migration helped bring it to my attention. â But one particular gentleman really inspired Wartinger. The man rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disneyâs Magic Kingdom, and then passed a small stone. Then he did it again and passed another. And then another. âThat was just too powerful to ignore,â Wartinger said. âIâd been hearing these anecdotal stories for a couple years, and then I thought, okay, thereâs really something here. â If there were a way to make people pass stones while they were still small, Wartinger realized, the potential benefits could be enormous. So Wartinger compiled peopleâs stories, and he realized that the common factor was having ridden Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. He found anecdotal reports of people passing stones after bungee jumping, but no research on this   approach. So he decided to take things into his own hands and do a proper study. First, Wartinger used a   printer to create a clear silicone model of that    patientâs kidney. He then filled the kidney with stones and urine. (Not real urine, I assumed, as I know the park already has plenty.) Then he and colleague Marc Mitchell bought two tickets and flew to Orlando. Of course, the researchers had to get permission from Disney World before bringing the model kidney onto the rides. âIt was a little bit of luck,â Wartinger recalls. âWe went to guest services, and we didnât want them to wonder what was going on â  two adult men riding the same ride again and again, carrying a backpack. We told them what our intent was, and it turned out that the manager that day was a guy who recently had a kidney stone. He called the ride manager and said, do whatever you can to help these guys, theyâre trying to help people with kidney stones. â Other parks, Wartinger says, âhave reacted anywhere from lukewarm to really not sure what to do with us. â The two held the backpack between them âat kidney heightâ to try to subject the model to the same forces that a person would experience. A stone was counted as âpassedâ if it moved from a starting location lodged in a calyx and fell down into a trap at the point where the kidney meets the ureters. None of the stones or fluid actually spilled out during the roller coaster ride. (The research protocol notes: âCare was taken to protect and preserve the enjoyment of the other guests at the park. â) âWhat was amazing was within just a few rides it became obvious that there was a huge difference in passage rates whether you sat in the front or the rear of the coaster,â Wartinger tells me. âThere was a lot more whipping around in that rear car. â The stones passed 63. 89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16. 67 percent. Thatâs based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: âPreliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a   roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones. â Now, though, he has done more than 200 total stone rides on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. But that doesnât mean itâs the only coaster that could be therapeutic: âSome rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldnât say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. Thatâs grossly inaccurate. â There are other kidney designs to consider, too, as every personâs calyceal system is different, like a fingerprint. But the idea is that if you rode a variety of roller coasters in a short period of time, that would help you pass small stones and lingering sediment before it accumulates into debilitating, costly, obstructive stones. Still to know if this works for sure, heâd need a prospective clinical trial using real people with real kidneys. I suggested that would be difficult. He said no, he has it all planned out: Take people with kidney stones and do an ultrasound before the ride and after, and see if the stone moves. Wartinger couldnât do that right away because universitiesâ institutional review boards would require experimental evidence to prove the concept first. This he seems to have done duly on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, with attention to detail. For example, I thought I was just clarifying one such detail when I asked if the âurineâ described in the model he brought to Disney was actually water. It was water, right? âNo, it was urine. It was mine. â I still wasnât sure if he was serious. I have no problem with urine, itâs just the idea of showing up at Disney with a   kidney in your backpack. âYeah, I used dilute urine. I spent my life playing in pee. I donât have that aversion to urine that most people have. The reason I didnât use water is it wouldâve put another variable in there that wasnât real. So I used real urine   â¦     to avoid criticism. â It seems he thought of everything. Including the fact that people will hear about this study and act on it before itâs validated in human trials. So his advice for now: If you know you have a stone thatâs smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10, 000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and âdustâ remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too. For people who hate roller coasters, like a number of people Iâve run this idea by, the ultimate goal would be a more clinical experience â  a way to move people in a controlled environment that would help them pass stones organically. Instead of sending people to a theme park, you might go down the hall to a   rollercoaster with a prescription for a precise pattern of pitches, yaws, and rolls designed around your particular kidney anatomy and the location of your particular stone."

The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal, authored by Rep. Sean Maloney ( . Y.) appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a    vote. Outraged Democrats shouted âshameâ and accused Republican leaders of abusing chamber rules by holding the vote open until they could twist enough arms to kill the amendment.   How can a 2 min vote become an 8 min vote? When you need to work for 6 mins to keep discriminating vs #LGBT. Watch: https:  .   â   Jim Himes (@jahimes) May 19, 2016  âThey literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality,â Maloney said. âWe won this vote. â Maloney told reporters that when he saw House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) âpersonally twisting arms on the floor,â he asked him to let the vote conclude only to be told to âto get back on my own sideâ of the aisle. In protest, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( .) took to the microphone to rail against Republicans as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) walked around the Democratsâ side of the floor waving a red vote card and urging her members to vote no on the underlying military construction and veterans programs spending bill so that Republicans âget the message. â The spending bill subsequently was passed on a    vote, with 57 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. The House fracas comes as a national debate is underway over LGBT rights. The battle has reached a fever pitch in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a measure to ban transgender individuals from using a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. Corporations boycotted the state after the measure was enacted, and the federal government and North Carolina have now slapped competing lawsuits against each other. [North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights] Tensions over the issue in the House surfaced in recent weeks when a provision was added to the annual defense policy bill by Rep. Steve Russell ( .) that would exempt religious organizations that contract with the federal government from certain parts of civil rights law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Democrats and some moderate Republicans decried the proposal, but earlier this week GOP leaders blocked them from holding a vote to strip the language from the defense bill when it was on the floor. The battle then moved to Thursday when the chamber considered one of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which historically have been allowed to have a more   amendment process. The vote on Thursday is just one chapter in a fight that promises to occupy Congress in the coming weeks as both Republicans and Democrats plan further legislative measures to force the House to take a stand on the divide over whether certain policies, such as those concerning hiring practices and public bathrooms, amount to LGBT discrimination or protections for freedom of religion. When and where the fight will be waged remains murky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) on Thursday declined to say whether Republicans would bring up measures to curtail the Obama administrationâs efforts on LGBT rights, which include his recent directive to schools to accommodate transgender students in the bathrooms of their choosing. Ryan told reporters only that that such matters âshould be left up to the states. â But Ryan âis engaged in understandingâ how the House will try to push back on the transgender bathrooms issue, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( ) said. âWeâve encouraged him, Iâve encouraged him, heâs been encouraged,â he added. One option may be a new bill from Rep. Luke Messer ( .) which seeks to block President Obamaâs executive order on transgender bathrooms by preventing the administration from withholding federal funding from schools that donât comply with the order. Messer said Thursday he is looking for   vehicles as potential avenues for the legislation, such as appropriations bills. âI can assure you weâll try to do something in appropriations on this issue for sure,â said Rep. Tom Cole ( .) a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and a close ally of its chairman and the Speaker. According to a new   poll, the country is divided almost evenly with 46 percent of all people answering that transgender people should use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they were born and 41 percent believing they should use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify. There is a stark partisan divide, however:   of Republicans and 66 percent conservatives say that transgender people should use the restroom corresponding to their gender at birth, while 60 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of liberals say they should be able to use the restroom with which they identify. As Republicans cue up measures to push back on the presidentâs   orders, Democrats said to exploit any divisions within the GOP  â   or short of that, expose them. âThese things are going to be remembered,â Maloney said of the Republicans who switched their votes, likening the act to being on âthe wrong side of the march toward Selmaâ and âstanding in the schoolhouse doorâ to prevent the integration of schools. He said these lawmakers would âhave this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers. â"," The United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and the European Union have written to China to express concern over three new or planned laws, including one on counterterrorism, in a rare joint bid to pressure Beijing into taking their objections seriously. The U. S. Canadian, German and Japanese ambassadors signed a letter dated Jan. 27 addressed to State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun, voicing unease about the new counterterrorism law, the draft cyber security law, and a draft law on management of foreign   organizations (NGOs). In what sources said was a coordinated move, the ambassador of the European Union Delegation to China, Hans Dietmar Schweisgut, sent a letter expressing similar concerns, dated Jan. 28. Reuters reviewed copies of both letters. The cyber security and counterterrorism laws codify sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats, from widespread censorship to heightened control over certain technologies. Critics of the counterterrorism legislation, for one, say that it could be interpreted in such a way that even   dissidents could fall within its definition of terrorism. The four ambassadors said areas of the counterterrorism law, which the National Peopleâs Congress passed in December, were vague and could create a âclimate of uncertaintyâ among investors. They did not specify which areas. The EU ambassador used the same phrase to describe the lawâs impact, and both letters expressed an interest in engaging with China as it worked out implementing regulations around the law, to try to mitigate those concerns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, asked about the letters, said all countries were enhancing their efforts to combat terrorism, and that he hoped other countries would respect Chinaâs sovereignty. âThe counterterrorism law will not affect relevant businessesâ normal operations and it will not affect relevant personnelâs legitimate interests,â he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Guo could not be reached for comment. Chinaâs State Council Information Office and Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment. While countries often give feedback on proposed legislation in China, the rare joint response by several major powers, and coordination with the EU, signals an increased readiness to lend weight of numbers to their argument. It also points to growing frustration that the   individual approach taken in the past may not be working. âWhile we recognize the need for each country to address its security concerns, we believe the new legislative measures have the potential to impede commerce, stifle innovation, and infringe on Chinaâs obligation to protect human rights in accordance with international law,â said a   letter   by the four ambassadors. China has defended the new and draft laws, saying such steps, including heightened censorship, were necessary to ensure stability in the country of over 1. 3 billion people. âCLIMATE OF UNCERTAINTYâ The diplomatic push comes as Beijing arguably needs cooperation from the signatories to the letters more than ever. A slowing Chinese economy and fragile markets highlight the importance of foreign investorsâ confidence. Chinese companies are increasingly looking to get approvals from foreign governments for acquisitions, and the European Union is debating whether to give China âmarket economyâ status. On the draft cyber security law, all five ambassadors were particularly concerned by provisions requiring companies to store data locally and to provide encryption keys, which technology firms worried may impinge on privacy and mean they would have to pass on sensitive intellectual property to the government in the name of security. Both letters said the draft NGO management law had the potential to hinder academic exchanges and commercial activities, calling them âcrucial elementsâ of their relationships with China. Critics have said the draft legislation risked choking off NGOsâ work by requiring them to get official sponsors and giving broad powers to police to regulate their activities. In the letters, the ambassadors asked China to open both draft laws to another round of public consultations. The U. S. embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. A spokesman for the EU Delegation had no comment when reached by Reuters. The German embassy declined to comment on the letter. The Japanese embassy said: âWe pay attention to Chinese movement over relevant laws or drafts of laws.â  A Canadian government spokesperson said Canada had expressed its concerns to Chinaâs government âabout a number of new laws and regulations that constrain civil society and hinder access to information. âWe have expressed these concerns through a variety of different approaches and will continue to raise these with the Chinese government,â the spokesperson added. The parties to the letters decided to express their concerns together after it became unclear to what degree China was taking their individual input on the laws on board, said a person with knowledge of the matter. âWeâre trying to avoid the divide and conquer approach (by China). They like to do that on any possible occasion. We wanted to send a   that when we have shared interests, we cannot so easily be split,â the person said, adding that there had been no clear response by China so far to the letters. âWe donât plan to establish a   relationship. We want something to happen.â  (Additional reporting by Michael Martina, Megha Rajagopalan and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Mike  ) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a âdeclaration of warâ which could trigger clashes within days. WASHINGTON U. S.

","Donald Trumpâs campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trumpâs use of funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts, telling CNNâs Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesnât take money as a salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trumpâs to give away. âYou know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trumpâs money,â Conway said, neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation since 2008. âThe Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in. â Donald Trumpâs campaign manager has only the utmost respect for former president George HW Bush, whose age she mentioned casually while discussing his alleged plan to vote for Hillary Clinton: Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that âour   communities are in the worst shape theyâve ever been . .. Ever. Ever. Ever. â The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage. A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. âImmigration security is national security,â he said, and repeatedly read the lyrics of the The Snake, a 1960s soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the consequences of the United States taking in refugees. The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as âthe vessel for all the global special interests seeking to run our livesâ and said that the âfailed political establishmentâ had âvestedâ in her âall of their money, all of their hopes for another generation of corruptionâ. Trump also argued that the âdishonest mediaâ had âbled this country dryâ. But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that the billionaire converted $258, 000 in donations to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that could potentially even force the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by bragging on Tuesday about spending âOPM  â   other peopleâs moneyâ. Texas senator and former presidential contender Ted Cruz declined to say if he plans to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, again: Donald Trump called for a more rigorous immigration policy following the arrest of an American man born in Afghanistan for bombing attacks in New York and New Jersey this weekend. The Republican presidential nominee spoke to supporters at High Point University in North Carolina today and reiterated his vow to build a wall on the   border. Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâs campaign has filed its September Federal Election Commission report for the month of August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic parties, from more than 1. 1 million contributions, with an average contribution of $50. The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank. âThe millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot,â campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. âWith voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to vote. â More than 60% of the campaignâs August contributions were from women, and roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200. The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began August. Donald Trumpâs latest comments maybe needs a  : Our African American communities are in the worse shape theyâve ever been. Ever. Ever. Ever. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, itâs relevant reading:  I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America. Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?â But in America, people said: âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you become a citizen?â America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable. With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow Americaâs example and work together to do more to support refugees. ... When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, itâs important that President Obama is setting this example. When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country. Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again. Fox News talking head Sean Hannityâs outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an   promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance. Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to soak up each othersâ awesomeness, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee: One of the reasons Iâm supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, heâs going to put originalists on the supreme court   people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers,   branches of government. Heâs a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe. And, of course, heâs gonna build that wall. He says heâs gonna have Mexico pay for it. Thatâs fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we donât want people competing for jobs. He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us  . And as somebody whoâs been a marksman since Iâm 11 years old, protecting our Second Amendment rights are paramount to me. The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds. On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  â   the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of Robert F Kennedy  â   that he plans to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, CNN is reporting that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponentâs spouse: Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to Bush   an extraordinary rebuke of his own partyâs nominee.  Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former presidentâs plans on 8 November. âThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,â Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. âHe is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. â The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans spend talking about   racial metaphors that were once used by Nazi war criminals, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a âtremendous asset to the campaign. â Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump campaign, the Republican nomineeâs communications team has elected to double down on the statement. âDon Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,â wrote communications advisor Jason Miller in a statement. âAmerica has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clintonâs planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do whatâs needed to protect us. â The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir William Eden   used a very similar metaphor in an address to Parliament: Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that partook of it. The Nevada Republican party seems eager to focus on   races this year. .. Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to Buzzfeed News, but the    candidateâs campaign is still breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the movements of the Republican nominee. Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trumpâs motorcade, a break in   tradition that the campaign originally promised to maintain. âWe have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,â Trumpâs pool reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. âWe have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on Trumpâs plane so it is a truly protective pool. They have not been responsive to that request. â The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his campaign plane, instead opting for a âchaserâ plane that had led to delays for reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. (Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in time.)","   David Cole, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, is author of the new book âEngines of Liberty: The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law. â   Liberals are understandably excited, and conservatives equally concerned, that the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scaliaâs death may be filled by a Democratic president  â   with either Merrick Garland, President Obamaâs nominee, or Hillary Clintonâs nominee, should she win the election. The courtâs ideological majority lies in the balance.  The conservatives have had a long run. While control of the presidency and both houses of Congress has changed hands multiple times over the past 40 years, the Supreme Court has been dominated by a consistent majority of conservative justices since the 1970s, even as some Republican appointees, such as David Souter and Harry A. Blackmun, proved to be liberal. The court is now evenly divided, with four liberal and four conservative justices. With a liberal majority in the offing, a whole new world of possibilities awaits. Or does it? History suggests otherwise. The Supreme Court under Chief Justices Warren E. Burger, William H. Rehnquist and John G. Roberts Jr. has overruled relatively few liberal constitutional precedents. Despite strong invitations to do so, the court did not reverse Roe v. Wade (protecting the right to choose an abortion) or Miranda v. Arizona (requiring warnings and legal assistance in interrogations). It has not ended affirmative action or overturned decisions banning the public display of religious symbols. Even if Garland or some other Democratic nominee is confirmed, therefore, major changes in existing constitutional doctrine are unlikely. The force of precedent imposes significant limits on the courtâs ability to change direction, even when its personnel change. Major transformations of constitutional law do occur, but they require much more than a new justice. They generally follow decades of persistent advocacy in a variety of forums, primarily outside the Supreme Court. The court is much more likely to recognize constitutional change than to generate it. And it tends to do so slowly, only after the ground of public opinion and state law has already shifted. Constitutional law changes incrementally, from the ground up, not suddenly, from the top down.    Four cases that could   the country will be heard when the Supreme Court meets this term without Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia consistently expressed conservative views when reviewing court cases. (Claritza   Washington Post)    Brown v. Board of Education,  which said segregated schools violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, came only after a   campaign by civil rights lawyers and activists. The court first recognized sex discrimination as a violation of equal protection only after the womenâs movement had transformed understandings of womenâs roles in society more generally. While some have criticized it as premature, the decision in Roe to protect a womanâs right to choose abortion similarly followed a political campaign for reproductive rights. The courtâs 2008 ruling that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms is attributable to three decades of concerted work by the National Rifle Association and its allies to develop and propagate the idea of a right to bear arms in other forums, including state legislatures, state courts, the political arena and the legal academy. The same is true for the newest constitutional right  â   of gay men and lesbian couples to marry on the same terms as heterosexual couples. In 1972, the court unanimously ruled that a petition arguing that the Constitution requires recognition of   marriage did not even present a serious legal question; it dismissed the petition with one line. Yet last year, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the court recognized a constitutional right to marriage equality. That remarkable shift cannot be explained by changed personnel. The court in 2015 was, if anything, more conservative than the court in 1972. Rather, one must look at the work that gay rights groups did in a wide variety of forums beyond the federal courts to change public opinion about the status of gay men and lesbians, and about the justice of their desire to marry. The Supreme Court did not so much change constitutional law on marriage equality as acknowledge that it had changed. Constitutional law will continue to develop in the   era. But the changes will come more from the sustained work of committed citizens than from the appointment of a new justice. Over the course of our history, the true catalysts of constitutional evolution have been not the justices  â   although they obviously play a necessary part  â   but the people, working together through civil society to make their own shared vision of constitutional ideals into law. Constitutional law reflects what we as a society deem to be our most fundamental values, and those values evolve. But in the most important sense, the impetus for change comes from us, not from the men and women who serve as justices of the Supreme Court.   Read more about this topic:   Richard A.

But now, with Cold War intrigue hotter than itâs been in decades, many curious new viewers are likely to flock to this series. At first, they may be quite surprised, because The Americans, more than anything else, is a family drama, in which the parents just happen to be Russian spies living in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC. The husband and wife, Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, were paired by mother Russia long ago to emigrate to the United States and have a couple of kids and run a small travel agency, while taking on serious and sometimes dangerous spy missions. Their kids are now teens, and their daughter Paige is old enough to ask questions, and notice and challenge things. Sheâs also embarked on a budding romance with the teen son of the   neighbor  â   who just happens to be an FBI agent investigating spies just like his seemingly innocent   neighbors. Elizabeth and Philip are played by Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, who are wonderful. The couple adopts various identities and disguises to spy for their homeland  â   sometimes together, other times alone. Based on the three episodes available for preview, the season features an overarching story about a possible U. S. plot to damage the Soviet wheat crops. But what really counts on The Americans, as always, are the dynamics within this quiet family suburb. As the season opens, mom Elizabeth introduces the teenage Paige to the real family business. Will Paige mature quickly enough to join her parents on a spy mission? And if so, how will that go? And the FBI agent has to learn, eventually, that the object of his investigation has been a trusted confidant the whole time  â   leading to the same sort of emotional climax as the one between Walter White and his    Hank on Breaking Bad.  These underlying tensions, between neighbors, and between children and parents, are what makes The Americans so quietly intense  â   and so interesting. Itâs also interesting to reflect how televisionâs depictions of Cold War tensions have changed over the decades. In the â60s, our mistrust of the Soviets was embodied by Boris Badenov, a scheming spy, along with his partner Natasha Fatale, for the fictional foreign country of Pottsylvania on the cartoon series Rocky  Bullwinkle. The American response to these foreign operatives, on TV, was the Mission: Impossible force, a U. S. spy operation so   that every mission began with a warning that the government, if confronted, would deny its existence. American TV viewers, in the 1960s, had no problem with that. But by the 1980s, the time frame in which The Americans is set, the concerns, and the paranoia, was heightened. ABC gave us 1983âs The Day After, a frightening   about a Russian nuclear missile attack on the American heartland  â   specifically, Lawrence, Kansas. ABC also gave us a 1987 miniseries called Amerika. It was set in the near future, and depicted life in the U. S. after the Soviets had succeeded in mounting a bloodless coup, with the President being a mere pawn for his Russian manipulators. Quite fittingly, an episode of The Americans, a few seasons ago, was all about the reactions of the various characters on that show, who were watching the 1983 premiere of The Day After. Its politics, and its power and topicality, got their attention then  â   just as FXâs The Americans deserves your attention now."

The potential answers point to a surprising view of the nature of the universe, and our place in it.","On March 17, 2014, a group of physicists announced a thrilling discovery: the âsmoking gunâ data for the idea of an inflationary universe, a clue to the Big Bang. For non-physicists, what does it mean? TED asked Allan Adams to briefly explain the results, in this improvised talk illustrated by Randall Munroe of xkcd.","Bees have been rapidly and mysteriously disappearing fromÂ rural areas,Â with grave implications for agriculture. But beesÂ seem toÂ flourish in urban environments -- and cities need their help, too. Noah Wilson-Rich suggests thatÂ urban beekeeping mightÂ play a role inÂ revitalizing both a cityÂ and a species.","Al Seckel, a cognitive neuroscientist, explores the perceptual illusions that fool our brains. Loads of eye tricks help him prove that not only are we easily fooled, we kind of like it.","Onstage at TED2012, Peter Diamandis makes a case for optimism -- that we'll invent, innovate and create ways to solve the challenges that loom over us. ""Iâm not saying we donât have our set of problems; we surely do. But ultimately, we knock them down.â"

The protesters who occupied Maidan, as the square is known, prepared for battle, stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013, after the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response, tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance.As the months passed, confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There, I photographed the fighters against a black curtain, a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire, ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here, I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history. With this realization, I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men, with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word ""costume"" because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment, irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves, this outward expression of masculinity, the ideal of the warrior.I worked slowly, using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old-fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February 20, which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers, loyal to the government, started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all, three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly, but celebration remained elusive in Maidan.As the days passed in Kiev's central square, streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people, filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before.I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day, my fixer, Emine, and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats, their shiny handbags, and the bunches of red carnations, white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there.It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are â not the way we look, but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict, not only in Maidan, and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior, then the women showed the implications of such violence.When I made these pictures, I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today, the death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan, the barricades have been dismantled, and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced, so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters, the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims, ""Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes."" Thank you. (Applause).","When we think of Nepal, we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas, the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes, or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills, where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener, there lives a great diversity of wildlife, including the one-horned rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately, these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals, battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks, but that is not an easy task, because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife.Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime, and these are drones, or more specifically, conservation drones. For about a year now, my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape, but it also allows you to capture detailed, high-resolution images of objects on the ground. This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential, not only for combating wildlife crime, but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations.So what is a drone? Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload, such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go.Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone, but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is, a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars.So now that you've built your own conservation drone, you probably want to go fly it, but how does one fly a drone? Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.So what can we do with a conservation drone? Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example, camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests, but these are motion-activated cameras, so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images, and that takes a lot of time, especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fiâenabled cameras.Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous, because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna, not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest.A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests.And finally, I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications.Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe, strongly believe, that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way, they are right. I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time, we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool, including drones, in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet.Thank you.(Applause)","(Music)Good afternoon.As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden.This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me: a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start, because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons, and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light. All of them are different colors, they're rippling with different frequencies, and they're bouncing off every surface, including me, and some of those are flying directly into your eyes, and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.Now a laser is different. It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye, you can use it to store massive amounts of data, and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent, but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency, an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero.Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction, so if you were to take the lid off that bottle, it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall, flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment, and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree, it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science: the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.But the experiment is not the end of the story, because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment, it seemed like the more he said, the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea, to really capture its essence, the fewer words you use, the better. In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking, my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words, scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly, it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for ""Dance Your Ph.D."" There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example, at the University of Minnesota, there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde, and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside, because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers, and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab, but before he does that, he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming, and when I visited David to learn about his research, he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy.(Laughter) (Applause)Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course, but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day. Now that assumes half-hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of 35,000 dollars, and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time, and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day, that would indeed add up to an annual waste of 100 billion dollars. Of course, that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool, and like any tool, it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA, it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence, the illusion of simplicity, and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example, our National Endowment for the Arts, with its $150 million budget, slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one-thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts, there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution, and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists, let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers. After all, they are the most perishable of their kind, prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds, we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help.Of course someday, in the deep future, a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented, rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However, I trust that by that day, we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. (Music) (Applause)","Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes. Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago. Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery. Do you know that surgery? Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty. Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it. But first you need to know two things about me. Just two things. I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids. Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?So my hip had been hurting me for years. I finally went to the doctor, which was free. And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free. Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting â almost a year. That is what free gets you. I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them. And you know, even I could tell my hip was bad, and I actually work in marketing. So he said, ""Allison, we've got to get you on the table. I'm going to replace your hip â it's about an 18-month wait."" 18 more months. I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. I would not have my new hip for TED2008. I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany. This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. Oh yeah.Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is? We do not think that way. We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians. ""After you."" ""Oh, no, no. After you."" Hey, are you from Canada? ""Oh, me too! Hi!"" ""Great! Excellent!""So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening. No, no. Front of the line.So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign. And I saw a sign. In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, ""Volunteers Needed."" Hmm. Well, they signed me up immediately. No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no. They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75. Yeah. They needed some young blood.So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss. I worked alone. Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop. While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, ""What do you do?"" Then I'd tell them, ""Well, I'm getting my hip replaced â in 18 months. It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"" All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop. So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification. I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office. And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them. Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line. And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that. Two reasons. First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip. But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all. Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.","As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design? What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore? If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience? If we could free ourselves from our education? What would these unseen forms look like? Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us? Would they delight us? If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?I propose we look to nature. Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms. And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes. We can abstract them and to create something that is new. Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells. And these cells can either be identical, or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces. We're free to choose where we make the fold. And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces. Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm. And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything. We can fold a million times faster, we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional, we start not with a single surface, but with a volume. A simple volume, the cube. If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks, for instance, like this. And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one. We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape, or this shape.So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. And we can play with this. We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. We can begin to sculpt the form.And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints. So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves, they can become impossibly small. We can make folds that we otherwise could not make. Surfaces can become porous. They can stretch. They can tear. And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.But in each case, I didn't design the form. I designed the process that generated the form. In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.But that's only half of the story â 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. A far more effective way to create forms, I have found, is to use information that is already contained in forms. A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges. White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones. We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are â all information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate, and that we can use to control the folding.So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one. There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation â it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again.So let's bring this process to architecture. How? And at what scale? I chose to design a column. Columns are architectural archetypes. They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology. A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. I started using four cylinders. Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this.And these columns, they have information at very many scales. We can begin to zoom into them. The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers. Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility. And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable? Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. In this case, the process is deterministic. There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable. There's too many surfaces, there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.So this leads to a new role for the architect. One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there. For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them. And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.But enough of the theory. At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue 3D glasses, got up very close to the screen, but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things. So there was only one possibility â to bring the column out of the computer.There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing. For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other. So instead, we decided to take the column, and we decided to build it as a layered model, made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top. Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery. From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce â and you're seeing a segment of it here â very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering, and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer. Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.But it was very labor intensive. There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical. It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces. The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium. And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.But it is increasingly possible. Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns, we used the bigger, faster machine, and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural, they can bear loads for once. Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. You can see a different column in the mirror, if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.So where does this leave us? I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects. I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature; there's countless other ones. In short, we have no constraints. Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up. And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.Thank you.

 on 19 Dec. 2015 // The car is much heavier than expected which gives it a nice weight and the wheels and paint finish are very well done. I love the size of it too.I bought this a present for someone else but as others reported that theirs arrived broken, so I opened it when it arrived and found one of the head lamps broken off and missing. It's not in the box so it must have been packed like that, which means I'm going to have to give someone a present that is not complete which sucks. And the stripes down the sides feel very flimsy and you can tell that they are going to break off quickly even with careful handling.Such a weird combination of quality and cheap finishes.As others have said, for the cost you would expect the doors to open at the very least. Or have the boys weapons on the seat, something that made it obvious that it was from the show and not just a regular Impala. With just a tiny bit more effort, this could have been a fantastic product. If they remade this product with those features I would buy one for myself in a heartbeat. | looks Great,  lacking in detail though ! // 4.0 // 20 Nov. 2014 // By

The 2008 United Nations System of National Accounts (2008 SNA) offers three plausible indicators for calculating growth: the volume of gross domestic product (GDP), real gross domestic income, and real gross national income. The volume of GDP is the sum of value added, measured at constant prices, by households, government, and industries operating in the economy. GDP accounts for all domestic production, regardless of whether the income accrues to domestic or foreign institutions.",,,"Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.","A general and continuing increase in an economyâs price level is called inflation. The increase in the average prices of goods and services in the economy should be distinguished from a change in the relative prices of individual goods and services. Generally accompanying an overall increase in the price level is a change in the structure of relative prices, but it is only the average increase, not the relative price changes, that constitutes inflation. A commonly used measure of inflation is the consumer price index, which measures the prices of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by a typical household. The consumer price index is usually calculated on the basis of periodic surveys of consumer prices. Other price indices are derived implicitly from indexes of current and constant price series."

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

Excluded are loans from funds administered by an international organization on behalf of a single donor government; these are classified as loans from governments. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

A ""complete"" vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data.

Estimates of neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality tend to vary by source and method for a given time and place. Years for available estimates also vary by country, making comparisons across countries and over time difficult. To make neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality estimates comparable and to ensure consistency across estimates by different agencies, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which comprises the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Division, and other universities and research institutes, developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information to reconcile differences. The method uses statistical models to obtain a best estimate trend line by fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates.","Consumer price indexes are constructed explicitly, using surveys of the cost of a defined basket of consumer goods and services."

Even when using an agile approach, there's still a need to forecast over a long time period. The challenge is to combine both a long-term vision and frequent, continuous delivery along the way. We tend to find that a lot of teams using JIRA are actually tracking and strategic goals in disconnected tools like spreadsheets, which can be quite painful and time consuming! So today I'm going to show you how our resident experts on planning, the JIRA Portfolio team, use JIRA Portfolio to combine long-term planning and agile development. Let's see how the team does it - are you ready to jump into some planning? Start with the big picture Every quarter, the JIRA Portfolio team does a full roadmap review and planning, along with reviewing and updating objectives and key results. To start off, the team first defines the strategic themes for the roadmap by answering general questions like, "" where are we going? "" and "" where should we be spending our time "" (note that they don't focus on questions like "" what specific features do we want to build "" ). Techniques for coming up with this high-level product strategy could fill a separate blog post, but it roughly involves reviewing customer suggestions on jira.atlassian.com , customer interview notes, and feedback from teams within Atlassian to identify structural gaps (the combination of these two are used to identify recurring/common/structural problems), as well as reviewing advancements in the market and the strategic goals of the the wider organization. The two dominant themes that came out of the latest planning session for the JIRA Portfolio roadmap ""Integrated planning"" (think a tighter integration with JIRA and JIRA Agile) and ""PPM at scale"" (think views and reports across multiple plans). There were lots of other themes, of course, but these two are the priorities and where the team decided they would devote most of their time. ProTip : Prepare to iterate! Distilling a roadmap to 3-5 crisp focus areas is hard! The team typically knows the outcome is good if the themes feel like ""stating the obvious,"" and the general response from peers is ""well, of course that's what you need to focus on... what else would make sense?"" Identify the big-ticket items Once the themes were decided on as a team (and, of course, backed by clearly-defined goals and success metrics), the Product Manager entered them into JIRA Portfolio. The team then got together again to think about what actually needed to be done in order to accomplish these themes, answering questions like ""what big chunks of work do we need to get done in order to deliver on this theme?"" or""what needs to happen in order to ensure that gets delivered?"" For example, when they sat down to see what they needed to accomplish for the theme ""Integrated planning,"" it resulted in things like ""simplified data management"" and ""live planning and snapshots."" . Note that while several initiatives are specific to the JIRA Portfolio team, there are also initiatives shared with and mostly driven by other teams inside Atlassian. For example, a new feature in the JIRA platform might require the JIRA Portfolio team to integrate with this new functionality. Get all the data in one place the time consuming but well worth the work. Those ""big chunks of work"" mentioned earlier, i.e. initiatives, now needed to be broken down into more consumable pieces, so it was time to . This was done as a combination of: Breaking down initiatives into new epics and stories : Brainstorming between product management, engineering, and UX designers, to slice out tangible and incrementally shippable pieces of work. This was done inside JIRA Portfolio, and once the epics and stories were ready for implementation, they were turned into actual JIRA issues. Importing existing issues : The Product Manager also imported all of the relevant epics and stories that already existed in JIRA such as customer suggestions gathered on jira.atlassian.com and assigned them to the right initiatives. ProTip : When importing a big amount of existing, un-estimated issues, it isn't necessary to estimate all of them individually. JIRA Portfolio allows you to enter a default estimate for both epics and stories. Taking an average value of past stories is usually sufficient for a rough plan, as long as the plan is then constantly updated and refined along the way. Gathering and grooming the backlog is definitely the most time consuming part - getting data from potentially multiple different JIRA projects and then assigning epics to the initiatives they set earlier. Once this is done, however, the result is an awesome global overview, with aggregated progress and status across initiatives and it is super easy to dive into planning. JIRA Portfolio Cloud recently launched (yay! ï¿½ï¿½ ) so the below shows you how the team tracked progress and status for this initiative. Time to start planning The JIRA Portfolio team uses story points for estimation, so the Product Manager just grabbed the team's velocity straight from the Agile Board. The team is actually growing so they have split work into two streams: JP Core (continuous improvement on version 1.x) and JP2 (fundamental changes towards 2.x). See the roadmap for the first time So, JIRA Portfolio took all of the team's planning and calculated a realistic schedule for the (yes, the dates in the schedule are blank to spur imagination). The schedule below is set to the initiatives view to see the projected start and end dates of each initiative. Play with ""what-if"" scenarios Now with roadmap done (or at least ""visible at last""), the team was in full planning mode! With all the data in place, the Product Manager and Development Manager in collaboration with program management, began to move around variables like earlier release dates, scope changes, feature date adjustments, and people planning. Trying different planning scenarios was especially important as the team was determining whether to add the functionality of cost planning and reporting into the scope of their 2.x release. Because the team had all of the data in , they were able to model these what-if scenarios and instantly see the impact a possible change might have on the future. This is also a great way to communicate openly with stakeholders and clearly point out the tradeoffs. See how reality lines up with goals It was now time to head back and look at those themes we spoke about earlier. So much planning and scoping had happened since then and the team was interested to see if the detailed plan matched the high-level targets for investment allocation. Thankfully, the plan looked quite balanced! ""Integrated planning"" was slightly underfunded relative to the target, as the plan contained more work on UX improvements and convenience functions. However, it was easy for the Product Manager and Development Manager to jump back into the the schedule and backlog to see what was driving this and how they could adjust. Put the plan to action As mentioned earlier, the team creates a lot of epics and stories directly in . Once the plan is done, they then create these epics and stories in bulk so that the team can actually work on the issue in JIRA and JIRA Agile. The team tries to keep the backlog on the agile board short and easily manageable, and typically only creates issues from the plan prior to the planning meeting for the next sprint. For any upcoming sprint, the relevant issues can be directly created from the schedule view. Ensure the plan is up to date The JIRA Portfolio team does these planning sessions quarterly, however, the plan is still updated after each sprint There are two key activities the Product Manager does after each sprint to keep the plan up-to-date: A to re-baseline with what has actually been done (which issues have been resolved, how much is remaining if still open). If new stories have been added somewhere in JIRA (either a scope change, or an epic has been broken down into detailed stories), the Product Manager imports these into JIRA Portfolio to check the impact on the plan. Share, discuss, communicate So what did the team do with this living, breathing plan? They shared it! plan at Atlassian so everyone is kept up to date and on the same page with what the plans are. that they have set up in the JIRA Portfolio space. It's great to share information with the whole team and to interactively play through planning scenarios! And thats a wrap! We know that's a lot to take in, so if you want more info, some live demos and the chance for Q&A, join Martin Suntinger, Principal Product Manager for JIRA Portfolio, in the next JIRA Portfolio webinar. to know how you're using JIRA Portfolio so tell us in the comments below!

Em financiamento no Kickstarter , o OLO simplesmente permite que vocÃª transforme o seu smartphone em uma impressora 3D. Exato, nÃ£o hÃ¡ qualquer pegadinha aqui: vocÃª vai imprimir formas fÃ­sicas por meio do seu celular. A impressÃ£o acontece da seguinte maneira: com um aparato apropriado (OLO), a luz que emana da tela de um smartphone acaba formando criaÃ§Ãµes plÃ¡sticas. Esse aparato possui um reservatÃ³rio de 400 cm cÃºbicos, 100 gramas de resina fotopolÃ­mera e uma tampa mecanizada para separar as Ã¡reas. Com um aplicativo para Android, iOS e Windows Phone , o OLO se encaixa no celular como um Cardboard, por exemplo. Ele utiliza as mesmas funÃ§Ãµes de uma impressora de projeÃ§Ã£o digital de luz (DLP) - normalmente, os projetores de luz sÃ£o grandes e caros nessas soluÃ§Ãµes; aqui, o emissor Ã© a tela do smartphone. Batizado de ""resina de luz do dia"", o lÃ­quido presente no OLO se solidifica por meio da luz branca. Assim, ""vocÃª pode criar objetos duros, flexÃ­veis, fundÃ­veis ou elÃ¡sticos"", diz a pÃ¡gina da OLO no Kickstarter. Ainda faltam 19 dias para o financiamento do OLO terminar . Contudo, a meta de US$ 80 mil (R$ 287 mil) jÃ¡ foi batida, e a equipe responsÃ¡vel jÃ¡ alcanÃ§ou US$ 1,6 milhÃ£o (R$ 5,7 milhÃµes). Para comprar o OLO, basta pagar cerca de R$ 355. Vale a pena ter uma impressora 3D em casa? Comente no FÃ³rum do TecMundo","BigQuery is Google Cloud Platform 's serverless analytics data warehouse. It's used by thousands of companies - both big and small - to store, understand, and analyze large amounts of data. Today, we're announcing a host of new features that make BigQuery more compatible with traditional big data workflows: Standard SQL Beta If you're familiar with the SQL standard or have used another standard-compliant SQL engine, you'll feel right at home with the Beta of BigQuery's revamped SQL dialect . Notable features that we've added with this new dialect include: More advanced query planning and optimization: BigQuery now provides very robust decorrelation, which allows you to write complex subqueries in any clause of your SQL statement (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) A richer type system with fully composable types: In addition to the existing data types BigQuery users are used to, we've added dates, times, arrays and structs, as well as additional support for timestamps Extended JOIN support: BigQuery now supports Theta JOIN , which offers the ability to use inequalities in your join key comparisons, as well as arbitrary expressions as JOIN conditions. While we think the updated dialect is a wonderful addition, there's no requirement that users switch, and for production use cases, we recommend users remain on the legacy SQL dialect. After we have a few more miles on the new dialect, we plan to launch it to general availability and recommend it as the default language for all projects. Identity & Access Management (IAM) Beta Now that BigQuery supports Standard SQL, you'll have more and more teams in your company requesting access to BigQuery projects. Earlier this year we announced Cloud IAM for Cloud Platform. We're now making IAM available for BigQuery as well, in Beta. This feature is currently being rolled out, so if you don't see it today you can expect it enabled on your projects this month - BigQuery roles will be made available in Google Cloud's ""IAM & Admin"" control panel. Cloud IAM fully automates managing permissions for BigQuery projects. Administrators can define fine-grained security policies they want for their users and resources. For example, let's say your marketing team needs to query data, but doesn't need to modify or upload data to get their job done. With Cloud IAM and Google accounts, this process is a breeze. Administrators can create several roles, such as viewer, editor, user or owner. Time based table partitioning Time based partitioning makes it easy and cost-effective for you to manage your data and write queries that span multiple days, months or years. You can now create tables with time-based partitions - you load the data, and BigQuery will automatically put it in the right partition. Querying partitioned tables is easy - you simply provide a date or range of dates you want, and BigQuery will limit data processed to the time interval specified. Imagine that you had a marketing campaign that spanned the length of 3 months. Here's an example of a query to analyze logs from the past 3 months. You no longer have to manually partition your tables beforehand - it just works! BigQuery only scans the data in the specified partitions, rather than the whole table. Not only is this query more performant, it also costs you a fraction of the cost of querying the full table! BigQuery and Kabam Businesses come to Cloud Platform for our unique data analytics platform, and today we'll show you one such example. Kabam i s an international entertainment company that produces free-to-play video games for mobile devices. Kabam's games include Marvel: Contest of Champions, Fast & Furious: Legacy, and Star Wars: Uprising. Their average gamer enjoys more than two hours of gameplay a day! Data analytics is critical to Kabam's ability to keep gamers engaged in a highly competitive marketplace. Marvel: Contest of Champions became wildly successful after its release in December of 2014. With big popularity comes big data - in-game events and logs were generating well over 1 TB of data per day, and their previous data warehouse was not able to handle this sudden scale. As a result, Kabam had no way to gather insights about the game for several weeks. Costas Piliotis, lead analyst on the game, had used BigQuery at a previous company and suggested the team to give it a try. In six days they were able to ingest hundreds of terabytes of past game telemetry data. More importantly, they could now query data over the lifetime of the entire game. Thanks to BigQuery, Kabam is able to store and understand every single player action within their games, from game monetization to fraud, from production bugs to level-completion statistics. Now that the data lives in BigQuery, Costas and his team are most excited about applying Cloud Platform's Machine Learning tools to the data to make their games even more entertaining. Here in the BigQuery team, we often hear stories like this one and immediately the question that follows from people who've never tried BigQuery is, ""How does this compare to my current data warehouse?"" Two weeks ago we shared a summary of a great series of experiments on cloud data warehouse solutions performed by Mark Litwintschik where BigQuery really stood out. We've made this short video to explain why BigQuery is unique, which we hope will inspire you to give it a try."

There are a number of different ways that this can be done.One way would be to watch manifest-versions for any new files dropped in there under the fail/pass area. Since a vmtest can make these fail I would start out with including anything in fail/pass and then eventually move to only doing pass. an example of this:/tmp/manifest-versions> find . | grep 1193.20.0 ./buildspecs/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/x86-alex_he-release/pass/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/x86-zgb_he-release/pass/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/x86-mario-release/pass/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/stumpy-release/fail/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/x86-zgb-release/fail/16/1193.20.0.xml./build-name/x86-alex-release/pass/16/1193.20.0.xmlAnother way would be to poll google storage and keep track of what versions you've already uploaded (Could be as simple as a file). The trick here though is making sure you are watching all branches not just the top of tree.

The grilled one is not moist that makes the lobster meat a little bit dry. And for the burger, I would rather have a burger somewhere else. The butter garlic sauce is unbeatable I asked for a second one every time. Just to avoid lunch and dinner time as it doesn't worth to queue that long for this. Tips: The one in Harvey Nichols has the shortest queue and most of the time none.",Went here one night with no reservatio n but we were welcomed and the food was amazing. Has an open kitchen and a good wine list. Friendly and generous waiters.,"We visited on a busy Saturday and should have booked as the restaurant was packed. We were prepared to wait and the staff did their very best to find us a table, and fortunately after a while we were shown downstairs to a comfortable banquette, and again met Irvine a friendly and efficient waiter from Mexico who for his sins has married an English girl.We had a set 2 course meal with a couple of glasses of red plus coffees which came to around Â£35 with a tip. We both had steak but I had a starter of rillettes de porc whilst the memsahib had a Greek salad with feta cheese - both were excellent as were the steaks. I saw a plate of creamed spinach going to another table and wished that we had also ordered a portion, but the whole meal was very good value.The set meals are great value but we must go back some time and spend more money for some moules along with a sirloin steak and a bottle of red, even if it means that I fall asleep at the matinee in the afternoon.","Yet again Tom and the guys served a wonderful Sunday roast. You cannot fault the food, service and Tom's wonderful Irish charm.One lamb roast, one half chicken, garlic roast potato's, fresh crunchy veg and plenty of gravy.Â£27 for two Sunday roasts and two desserts. Spend that in Toby or Harvester and the food will never be half as goodGoing to have to try a mid week meal, gammon, eggs and chips sounds just right!Please pop in and say hi to Tom, have a pint and a meal, you won't be disappointed.",We were given our own restaurant room and shared a number of meat and vegetarian dishes which were very good. With the surprise belly dancer - it made the whole evening worth it - just to see my friend's rather bemused faces. The lady who did the dancing was a good sport. Would I recommend this restaurant. yes but probably better for groups maybe rather than couples.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is defined as an investment involving a long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest in and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) of an enterprise resident in a different economy (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate). Such investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent transactions between them and among foreign affiliates.
FDI inflows and outflows comprise capital provided (either directly or through other related enterprises) by a foreign direct investor to a FDI enterprise, or capital received by a foreign direct investor from a FDI enterprise. FDI includes the three following components: equity capital, reinvested earnings and intra-company loans. Data on FDI flows are presented on net bases (capital transactions' credits less debits between direct investors and their foreign affiliates). Net decreases in assets or net increases in liabilities are recorded as credits, while net increases in assets or net decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits. Hence, FDI flows with a negative sign indicate that at least one of the three components of FDI is negative and not offset by positive amounts of the remaining components. These are called reverse investment or disinvestment.

FDI stock is the value of the share of their capital and reserves (including retained profits) attributable to the parent enterprise, plus the net indebtedness of affiliates to the parent enterprises.","Coverage in terms of years, as well as data items, varies from country to country depending on data availability.

These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income.

National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies.

Almost all national poverty lines are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. The data is based on the two most recent years for which survey data are available.

Survey year is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which most of the data were collected.","Separate national poverty lines are often constructed for the rural and urban areas of a country. Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households. These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income.

National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies.

Almost all national poverty lines are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. The data is based on the two most recent years for which survey data are available.

Survey year is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which most of the data were collected.","Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households.

They stated this was not due to a breach of their own systems. The card replacement specifically replaces the security codes on the back of the card withouth changing the card holders current account number.They have stated to their members this was strictly a security measure on behalf of Discover Financial Services. No information was communicated in the letter that the members card had been compromised. ,"It was confirmed that several customers of the Camelot 
            branch, at Cape Coral Parkway and Chiquita Boulevard, who used their debit cards have had their accounts fraudulently charged because someone placed a skimming device on the ATM. The device collected 
            each person's card information, including personal identification 
            numbers, and allowed different debit cards to be created with 
            that information.",Credit and debit card numbers were stolen using bogus checkout-line card readers resulting in card numbers processed at those terminals being captured and some to be misused.,"On December 27, a customer reported fraudulent charges on her credit card after using it at the station.  Later cases of identity theft were also traced to the gas station.UPDATEÂ (1/6/11): The gas station closed shortly before customers started reporting fraudulent charges. Â The former owner and two other people are being sought for questioning. Â Customers had their debit and credit card information captured by a skimming device when they used their cards at a store ATM or inside the store.UPDATEÂ (1/10/11): The total number of victims is now at 380 and over $109,000 in fraudulent charges have been made.","Wesco gas stations experienced 
            a breach in credit card transactions from July 25-Sept. 7 resulting 
            in inaccurate charges to customer accounts."

Republican Bill Brief for: House Sub. SB42 

Date Passed Committee: 03/13/17 

 
 Bill Brief Author:  Rep. Jennings 
  
Sponsored by:  House Corrections & Juvenile Justice Committee 
 
A Bill Concerning:   Juvenile Offenders â Trailer Bill to 2016 SB 367 
 
What Bill Does:   This legislation makes changes to the juvenile offender code as revised in the 2016 session of 
the legislature through passage of SB 367. The original bill, HB 2466, contained one provision that altered the 
possible penalties for the use of a firearm during the commission of an offense by a juvenile.  HB 2466 bill was 
amended in committee and the contents of the amended bill were inserted into SB42.  The bill does the 
following: 
 

1.   Establishes a special sentencing rule for offenses where the juvenile uses a firearm in the commission of 
the offense.  The special sentencing rule will provide that upon a finding of the trier of fact that a firearm 
was used by the offender, the offender may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a 
minimum term of six months and a maximum term of 18 months regardless of whether the underlying 
offense committed would be an offense for which commitment to a correctional facility would otherwise 
be available. 

2.  Requires the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain a statewide searchable database that 

contains information regarding juvenile participation in immediate intervention programs.  Access to the 
database will be required to include county and district attorneys, judges, community supervision 
officers and juvenile intake and assessment officers.  

3.  Provides that when a juvenile offender absconds from supervision the act of absconding does not 

constitute a âtechnical violationâ of the conditions of supervision and upon reasonable efforts to locate 
the juvenile a warrant may be issued by the court. Current law requires three technical violations of 
supervision before revocation can occur.  Probation term limits and overall case length limits shall be 
tolled during the period that the offender absconded. 

4.  Defines the point in time in the proceeding of a juvenile offender case upon which the counting of days 

towards the imposed detention limitation of 45 days is calculated.  The count of detention days will 
commence upon disposition (sentencing) or 15 days following adjudication, whichever is sooner. 

5.  Changes the current limitation of 3 months to the total case time limit when removal of the offender 

from the home is necessary because the victim of a sex offense normally resides in the same residence as 
the offender. 

6.  Renames the juvenile justice improvement fund to the evidence-based program account of the state 
general fund and provides the Secretary of Corrections the ability to transfer funds projected to be 
available as a result of savings generated by juvenile justice reform when identified rather than the 
current method of annual transfer at the conclusion of the fiscal year.  Funds deposited in the evidence-
based program account remain out of reach for allotment by the Governor and are limited in their use for 
community programs and no other governmental purpose. 

7.  Incorporates identical language as found in the Code for Care of Children regarding specific findings 

with respect to reasonable efforts having been taken to avoid the out of home placement.  These findings 
are required to be made by the court upon an initial out of home placement in order to assure eligibility 
for federal IV -E support for juvenile offenders when placed out of home.  These findings in no way 

modify the findings required to be made by the court with respect to the initial order of out of home 
placement and only serve to supplement those findings in order to protect the interest of the state in 
assuring the highest level of federal funding available. 

8.  A technical change to eliminate duplicative language regarding required family reintegration efforts of 
the Department of Children and Family Services when a Child in Need of Care proceeding is ongoing 
during the term of a juvenile offender proceeding or dispositional case length limit period. 

9.  Changes the number, membership and role of the Kansas Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee.  The 

number of members is increased from 19 to 21.  The two additional members include one member 
appointed by the Chair of the Kansas Advisory Group (KAG) on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention from the youth membership of the KAG. The second additional member is a detention center 
director appointed by the Attorney General. The duties of the committee are expanded to include 
creating a plan to address the mental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system and review the 
collaborative work of the Department of Corrections and the Office of Judicial Administration and make 
recommendations when there is not consensus between the two.  

10. Includes certain modifications to the law pertaining to Immediate Intervention Programs (IIP) (formerly 

known as diversion agreements) 

a.  Provides that permitting participation in an IIP for a misdemeanor sex offense is within the 

discretion of the prosecutor and not automatically available to the offender. 

b.  In the case of a juvenile who is originally charged with a felony offense and a plea agreement is 

reached for a plea to a misdemeanor, the offender is not automatically entitled to an IIP if the 
offense constitutes a first-time misdemeanor offense.  Participation in an IIP would be within the 
discretion of the prosecutor. 

c.  The prosecutor may exclude an offender from mandatory participation in an IIP when the 

prosecutor declines prosecution. 

d.  Mandatory availability of an IIP for a misdemeanor offense will apply only to the first event of a 

misdemeanor violation.  Second or subsequent instances of misdemeanor violations, when the 
offender has previously participated in an IIP, the prosecutor will have discretion to permit 
additional instances of participation in an IIP.  

11.  Amends the placement matrix statute (version effective July 1, 2017) to consolidate the categories of 

serious offender III and serious offender IV, which carry the same risk-level requirements and JCF 
commitment terms, into a single serious offender III category. 

 
Political Reality/Implications:   Affords prosecutors and judges greater discretion in certain circumstances, 
holds youth accountable for their behavior in ways appropriate to their developmental stage and enhances 
public safety through providing evidence-based interventions within the community that change behavior of 
offending youth. 
 
Committee Amendments:   Yes 
 
Possible Floor Amendments:  Yes - but none known now.

*Note:  The process method used to construct the bill was not particularly conducive for conferees to indicate 
status as a proponent, opponent or neutral.  All presenting are being reported as a conferee. A brief summary of 
their position is provided.  Their full written testimony is available on the legislative website under the 
Correction and Juvenile Justice Committee minutes tab.  
 
Fiscal Note:   No fiscal implications outside of agency existing resources.  Incremental expense in an unknown 
amount may be incurred because of the IIP database requirement.  However, it is contemplated this component 
of data may be added to an existing information management system program without significant expense.  
Some lost savings as a result of expanding the offenses in which a firearm is used to allow for juvenile 
correctional facility commitment may occur. 
 
Who will carry the bill:   Rep. Jennings 
 
Is this bill ready to run on the floor?  Yes

Perguntei onde estava essa regra no site , a mesma disse que tinha no regulamento mas nao mostrou. Depois de meia hora de conversa perguntei se a garantia podia ser em DINHEIRO e a mesma disse que NAO.. depois foi perguntar a um superior , onde disse que poderia ser. FuncionÃ¡ria totalmente mecÃ¢nica e invasiva queria saber quanto em dinheiro tÃ­nhamos trazido para viajem .

Got your attention when you ask for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be lost, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked them into letting me go
It's no Picasso, Michelangelo
Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the Masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
If suddenly you're out of the woods
Then inside of an alley you're out of words
Well I thought it was radium at first
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no one else to blame
For us two
Some things they don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth is we're all to blame
There are lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll
Something 'bout how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed
And I laughed and you left and I left?
Send me on the lonely other side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?

I wish I would have shot him in the leg, then he would be here. Those investigators were just trying to convict somebody. My gun had a hair trigger. Veronica told me to come and get my herb book and she went to the back of the closet. Her kids had asthma and I lent her the book. She said she would give it to me next time. She didn't want to break up, we still talked. She told me to come over. John Gomez said Veronica does not have the money for your book so don't come over. Me being a hot shot I went over there and I had my gun. I had children and nephews where I lived so I had to keep my gun in my truck for self defense. Veronica invited me in her house, the kids were still awake fixing to go to bed. I put the gun under my shirt and said Hi to Josh and Cassandra. John Gomez was there he told Veronica that ""he doesn't love you"" I didn't care.  "," Ah, just ah sorry ya'll. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya'll to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that apologize to you. I'm real sorry for it. I was raised by the California Youth Authority, I can't really pin point where it started, what happened but really believe that's just the bottom line, what happened to me was in California. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but ah they create monsters in there. That's it, I have nothing else to say. Thanks for coming Jack.  "
