While Bernie Sanders assured cheering supporters at a Los Angeles rally overnight that he plans to keep fighting, Fox News confirmed that the presidential candidate plans to lay off âover halfâ his staff in the next week.  And the math  â   which even he acknowledged  â   does not look good. Clinton pocketed a victory in California, the biggest prize of the night and a state Sanders had fought hard to win. All told, Clinton is projected to win an outright majority of pledged delegates, while reaching the 2, 383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from   âsuperdelegatesâ  â   party officials who can support any candidate they want.  Sanders all along has challenged the legitimacy of those insiders, but at this stage he would need to convince the lionâs share of Clinton superdelegates to abandon her to deny her the nomination on the convention floor, a virtually unprecedented feat. While his supporters egged him on and could be heard booing at the mere mention of Clinton during his early morning rally, his position in the race at this stage would appear to leave them in limbo  â   backing a candidate whose path to the nomination has all but vanished.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â Still, Sanders pledged to campaign through the finale primary Tuesday in Washington, D. C. and go on to the Democratic convention. He vowed to âtake our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. â In a potential move toward reconciliation, the White House revealed that President Obama called both Clinton and Sanders Tuesday night  â   and plans to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday, to discuss âhow to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters.â Clinton earlier claimed victory over Sanders  â   after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win  â   during a lofty speech to supporters in Brooklyn. âThanks to you, weâve reached a milestone,â Clinton declared, upon becoming the first woman in American history to top the ticket of a major political party.  Marking the historic moment, Clinton said: âThis campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits on any of us. â She also congratulated Sanders, calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party  â   while also saying this is a moment to âcome together. â Sandersâ vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Clintonâs superdelegates to force a contested convention. They do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month. Pledged delegates, however, are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucus. Fox News projects that Clinton will still have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention    making it more difficult for Sanders to argue sheâs winning only because of support from superdelegates. Sanders did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakotaâs Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary. A total of six states were voting Tuesday Clinton won the rest. On the GOP side, Donald Trump    the only major Republican left in the race  â   was projected to win the primaries in California, Montana, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico. Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night, winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nomination. Marking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. Trump said: âTonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. â Previewing the general election battle, he slammed the Clintons, alleging they âturned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. â He also appealed to Sanders supporters, saying, âWe welcome you with open arms. â Clinton, in her victory speech, also took shots at Trump, claiming he would âtake America backwards. â âThe stakes in this election are high, and the choice is clear. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president,â she said. The Democratic Party pressure on Sanders, meanwhile, is sure to mount in a matter of days, if not hours. Obama reportedly is planning to get behind Clinton and start campaigning for her, and senior Democrats have been voicing mounting frustration with Sandersâ campaign. At the same time, the senator has touted general election polls suggesting he may be better positioned to go up against Trump in the fall.    ","At its best, the Supreme Court functions precisely as it was intended: as an antidemocratic brake on popular legislative and presidential passions when those passions do violence to the law, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. At its worst  â   and it often has been at its worst of late  â   it functions like Iranâs Guardian Council, a collection of   faqihs and jurists that sits above and outside the political process, using its position and privilege to impose on the nation a narrow set of social values decocted from the political ether. With the death of Antonin Scalia and the prospect of replacing him, we are faced once again with the question: Does the law mean what it says, or does it mean whatever people with power want it to mean at any given moment? The habitual labeling of Scalia as a âconservative,â as though he were simply using the Court to do what Jeff Sessions does in the Senate or Ken Buck does in the House, is a libel. As opposed to the       approach of the Courtâs Alice in Wonderland progressives, Scalia often reached decisions that annoyed conservative political activists  â   because the law demanded it. The Left complains that Scalia was an unthinking âfundamentalistâ on the Second Amendment, without taking a moment to consider that he approached the First Amendment in precisely the same way. When conservative legislators wanted to abridge   protections by passing a statute against flag burning, it was Scalia who stood in the way. EDITORIAL: Antonin Scalia, R. I. P.  â   Honor His Legacy as a Foe of Judicial Imperialism, The discussion surrounding Scalia and the fight over his replacement treats Scaliaâs philosophy  â   that the law says what it means and means what it says  â   as though it were exotic, or as if it were a quaint relic of some simpler age. But what is the alternative? Share article on FacebookshareTweet The alternative is to make the Supreme Court a   mob in a   society. We already are dangerously close to that point. No thinking person doubts that Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer will find a way to produce the outcome that the Left desires in any important case. Kagan lied to the Senate about her thinking on the question of gay marriage in order to have the opportunity to enact that thinking from the highest court. Never mind that the Constitution does not actually say what they wish it said about gay marriage, abortion, gun ownership, or the fact that First Amendment protections go well beyond the editorial board of the New York Times: If the Left demands a constitutional right to   abortion manufactured out of whole cloth, or that the words âthe right of the peopleâ be magically transformed into âthe National Guardâ in the case of the Second Amendment, these   justices will deliver. RELATED: Should the Senate Defer to the Presidentâs Supreme Court Picks? The Democrats introduced the contemporary approach to Supreme Court confirmation hearings  â   as partisan bar brawl  â   with the nomination of Robert Bork by President Ronald Reagan. In his famous, howlingly dishonest denunciation of the nominee, Senator Ted Kennedy proclaimed: The damage that President Reagan will do through this nomination, if it is not rejected by the Senate, could live on far beyond the end of his presidential term. President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to . . . impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and on the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.

And it isnât only an argument for voting against, filibustering, and otherwise trying to stop the nomination of   activists to the Supreme Court, and to other federal courts, as a general rule. If indeed Senator Kennedy was correct that the Senateâs duty is to prevent the president from imposing a defective view of the Constitution on future generations of Americans, then the Senateâs duty is to insist on nominees who share Scaliaâs view about the fundamental issue: That the law means what it says, and that it is not a writ for seers in black robes to pull out of the penumbras whatever suits them. By all means, send whatever bum Barack Obama puts forward back to his campus office with a swift kick in the pants. But that is only the beginning. Preventing further damage to the Court  â   and to the Constitution  â   in the here and now is necessary. Restoring the integrity of the Supreme Court, and reinvigorating faith in the rule of law for which it purportedly stands, will prove a long and difficult project.,","Mulvaney was likely parroting the   conservative belief that PBS  â   with cultural programming like Masterpiece Theater and Antiques Roadshow  â   is too highbrow, and geared solely towards âcoastal elites. â  Yet he may have seemed woefully out of touch with the needs and desires of economically struggling families to Vicenta Medina, an immigrant mother from Mexico. While she and her husband Gilbert struggled to raise their family on the South Side of Chicago forty years ago, she says Sesame Street helped teach English to their young son David. They watched him go on to collect degrees from both Harvard and the University of Chicago, and then work in the Obama White House â  where I first heard his story from a mutual friend. The Medinaâs story of a   family benefiting from public television is hardly anecdotal. Strong research shows that PBS programs such as Sesame Street have proven academic benefits for young audiences  â   especially those from more underprivileged households. According to a 2015 National Bureau of Economic Research study by University of Marylandâs Melissa Kearney and Wellesley Collegeâs Phillip Levine, exposure to Sesame Street is an extremely   intervention that has increased grade readiness for children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The effect is especially pronounced for boys and minority children, who have seen their likelihood of being below grade level decrease by as much as 16 percent. A number of earlier studies have also discovered positive academic impacts. One study found that children who watched Sesame Street frequently in   earned   grade point averages almost 16 percent higher than those of children who didnât grow up watching the show. Another from the University of Wisconsin concluded that children who watch international versions of the program gain nearly 12 percentile points on learning outcomes, as compared to those who donât watch the show. In Bangladesh,    viewers of the local version of Sesame Street were found to have 67 percent higher literacy scores, as compared to those who donât watch. And the benefits of programs like Sesame Street are not limited to academic achievement. A report from the Future of Children, a collaborative effort from Princeton University and the Brookings Institution, indicated that kids who watched Sesame Street formed more positive attitudes toward people from different backgrounds. That finding was replicated in Ireland, where exposure to the show promoted an increased propensity toward inclusiveness among   and   children. A study that examined Israeli and Palestinian children had similar conclusions. This is no small deal at a time when the country is seeing the number of hate incidents rising.   If there is an out of touch or elitist attitude toward PBS, it is the one implied by the OMB Director: The notion that lower income parents donât value this free educational television in the way suburban parents do, or that they and their families cannot appreciate the historical and educational documentaries that appear on PBS â  covering topics from Lewis and Clark to the Civil War to Jackie Robinson â  just doesnât match up with the facts. Surveys found that nearly   of poorer families reported that PBS KIDS âhelps a lotâ to prepare their children for school. PBS stations reach more kids ages two to five, more moms with young children, and more children from   families â  9 million in fact â  than any other kids TV network. And parents have confidence in PBS, with 66 percent saying they completely trust PBS KIDS to provide high quality programming â  thatâs 12 percent higher than the next closest competitor. The   proposed in the budget is a dubious one. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting cost the federal government just $445 million last year â  approximately one hundredth of one percent of the entire federal budget, and only about   of the $2. 8 billion in annual health care tax cuts the current Republican plan gives to the top 400 families alone â  a group with average incomes of $300 million. In a nation divided by inequality in income, schools, and neighborhoods, PBS is one equalizer â  providing all kids, regardless of economic background, the chance to watch and learn for free from the likes of Elmo, Bob the Builder, and the impressive show, Sid the Science Kid. Families with a lower household income report having fewer resources for school preparedness, and PBS can help fill that gap by providing free,   educational experiences.   It is difficult to imagine that the White House can defend the deep and painful cuts to programs that are vital to middle class and working poor families. But one way they canât defend the elimination of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is by suggesting that its efficacy lacks evidence, and has no support from working parents in   urban and rural areas who rely on this educational programming to improve their childrenâs future.",", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Finlandâs tax authorities have demanded a national broadcaster hand over information related to the Panama Paper leaks or be subject to search warrants for its newsroom and its journalistsâ homes, the broadcaster, Yle, said. Yle said the Finnish Tax Administration set an April 29 deadline to receive information, but the broadcaster has refused to share anything, citing journalist ethics and the need to protect source confidentiality. Yle, which is mostly state owned, will appeal to the nationâs judiciary, its lawyer said Monday. Yle journalists were among the 400 reporters in 80 countries who spent a year combing through the 11 million documents first obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. In an   last week, Marit af BjÃ¶rkesten, the director of Yleâs Swedish division, and Ville VilÃ©n, Yleâs creative director, explained why Yle would fight the tax agencyâs request: If out of a network of 400 journalists participating in the project, Finnish journalists alone were to hand over any information to a third party, Yleâs access to the material would presumably be immediately be revoked. We could no doubt live with this. What would be more serious is that Yleâs actions would jeopardise the chances of Finnish journalists participating in international investigative networks. Who would involve a journalist from a country where there is a risk that officials can demand  â   and receive  â   confidential information? How reliable would others consider an organisation that officials could barge into to confiscate files? Could Finns themselves ever rely on journalists to protect their sources? The Panama Papers leak revealed last month the secret offshore companies of dozens of wealthy individuals in more than 50 countries. In Finland, hundreds of people, ranging from entrepreneurs and athletes to convicted felons, were named in the documents, pulled from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama. The financial activities are not necessarily illegal, but offshore companies can be exploited to allow their owners to conceal their assets from their native governmentâs tax authorities. When the first news reports on the leak emerged, Finlandâs finance minister, Alexander Stubb, said, âNow it is up to the police and other authorities to evaluate whether illegalities have taken place involving Finns. â Last week, Stubb said âthereâs nothingâ his office could do about the    over the information, calling it âan issue between Yle and the tax authorities. â             Like this?

Please follow the steps below, East Lansing, Michigan, becomes a ghost town during spring break. Families head south, often to the theme parks in Orlando. A week later, the Midwesterners return sunburned and bereft of disposable income, and, urological surgeon David Wartinger noticed, some also come home with fewer kidney stones. Wartinger is a professor emeritus at Michigan State, where he has dealt for decades with the scourge of kidney stones, which affect around one in 10 people at some point in life. Most are small, and they pass through us without issue. But many linger in our kidneys and grow, sending hundreds of thousands of people to emergency rooms and costing around $3. 8 billion every year in treatment and extraction. The pain of passing a larger stone is often compared to child birth. For years in practice, Wartinger noticed anecdotal reports from patients who had passed small kidney stones during and immediately after visiting the Disney theme parks. It was a correlation he might not have noticed in another place, he told me: âThis mass migration helped bring it to my attention. â But one particular gentleman really inspired Wartinger. The man rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disneyâs Magic Kingdom, and then passed a small stone. Then he did it again and passed another. And then another. âThat was just too powerful to ignore,â Wartinger said. âIâd been hearing these anecdotal stories for a couple years, and then I thought, okay, thereâs really something here. â If there were a way to make people pass stones while they were still small, Wartinger realized, the potential benefits could be enormous. So Wartinger compiled peopleâs stories, and he realized that the common factor was having ridden Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. He found anecdotal reports of people passing stones after bungee jumping, but no research on this   approach. So he decided to take things into his own hands and do a proper study. First, Wartinger used a   printer to create a clear silicone model of that    patientâs kidney. He then filled the kidney with stones and urine. (Not real urine, I assumed, as I know the park already has plenty.) Then he and colleague Marc Mitchell bought two tickets and flew to Orlando. Of course, the researchers had to get permission from Disney World before bringing the model kidney onto the rides. âIt was a little bit of luck,â Wartinger recalls. âWe went to guest services, and we didnât want them to wonder what was going on â  two adult men riding the same ride again and again, carrying a backpack. We told them what our intent was, and it turned out that the manager that day was a guy who recently had a kidney stone. He called the ride manager and said, do whatever you can to help these guys, theyâre trying to help people with kidney stones. â Other parks, Wartinger says, âhave reacted anywhere from lukewarm to really not sure what to do with us. â The two held the backpack between them âat kidney heightâ to try to subject the model to the same forces that a person would experience. A stone was counted as âpassedâ if it moved from a starting location lodged in a calyx and fell down into a trap at the point where the kidney meets the ureters. None of the stones or fluid actually spilled out during the roller coaster ride. (The research protocol notes: âCare was taken to protect and preserve the enjoyment of the other guests at the park. â) âWhat was amazing was within just a few rides it became obvious that there was a huge difference in passage rates whether you sat in the front or the rear of the coaster,â Wartinger tells me. âThere was a lot more whipping around in that rear car. â The stones passed 63. 89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16. 67 percent. Thatâs based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: âPreliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a   roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones. â Now, though, he has done more than 200 total stone rides on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. But that doesnât mean itâs the only coaster that could be therapeutic: âSome rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldnât say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. Thatâs grossly inaccurate. â There are other kidney designs to consider, too, as every personâs calyceal system is different, like a fingerprint. But the idea is that if you rode a variety of roller coasters in a short period of time, that would help you pass small stones and lingering sediment before it accumulates into debilitating, costly, obstructive stones. Still to know if this works for sure, heâd need a prospective clinical trial using real people with real kidneys. I suggested that would be difficult. He said no, he has it all planned out: Take people with kidney stones and do an ultrasound before the ride and after, and see if the stone moves. Wartinger couldnât do that right away because universitiesâ institutional review boards would require experimental evidence to prove the concept first. This he seems to have done duly on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, with attention to detail. For example, I thought I was just clarifying one such detail when I asked if the âurineâ described in the model he brought to Disney was actually water. It was water, right? âNo, it was urine. It was mine. â I still wasnât sure if he was serious. I have no problem with urine, itâs just the idea of showing up at Disney with a   kidney in your backpack. âYeah, I used dilute urine. I spent my life playing in pee. I donât have that aversion to urine that most people have. The reason I didnât use water is it wouldâve put another variable in there that wasnât real. So I used real urine   â¦     to avoid criticism. â It seems he thought of everything. Including the fact that people will hear about this study and act on it before itâs validated in human trials. So his advice for now: If you know you have a stone thatâs smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10, 000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and âdustâ remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too. For people who hate roller coasters, like a number of people Iâve run this idea by, the ultimate goal would be a more clinical experience â  a way to move people in a controlled environment that would help them pass stones organically. Instead of sending people to a theme park, you might go down the hall to a   rollercoaster with a prescription for a precise pattern of pitches, yaws, and rolls designed around your particular kidney anatomy and the location of your particular stone.","âI know we are not going to win at some point   â¦     I know whatâs going to happen to me when we donât. â Manchester City were unbeaten and still freewheeling through the light traffic of early season when Pep Guardiola was asked in September about his chances of winning the quadruple. His reply was most memorable for its exasperated, commendably fluent grasp of English swearing. More significant was his realism about the traps already laid, the sense of   real or imagined, that has always been waiting to break. And so it came to pass. Fifteen league games and a relativity small helping of tactical free jazz into Guardiolaâs first season as City manager, the dawning of the age of Pep has already begun to chug through its first spell of heavy weather. City play Arsenal at the Etihad on Sunday at the end of a week of diffuse but genuinely fascinating pressure, alleviated a little by victory at home to Watford on Wednesday. As   systems go, the current squall doesnât seem to have a lot to do with points gained, likely longâterm outcomes, or much beyond the thrillingly tenacious identity politics of English football. City are fourth in the Premier League, with more points at this stage than in four of the last seven seasons. There have been bumps and jolts but Guardiola took a while at his previous clubs to groove the machine and junk the spare parts. He remains the acme of the Prozesstrainer coach, whose methods must be taken like a dose of medicine, complete with minor side effects and a need to complete the course. The noises off will continue, and rightly so given the run of five wins in 16 matches across all competitions albeit stoked by a degree of iconoclastic glee at the   defeat by an inspired Leicester City. Plus, of course, there is the business with the tackles. To recap: pressed on the fact City had failed to âwin a tackleâ in the opening 35 minutes against Leicester, Guardiola went off on one of his familiar prickly,   digressions, announcing at one stage: âWhat is tackles? I donât coach tackles. â At which point you could almost hear the headline klaxon, the high fives back on the desk, the   slogans being printed. Oh, Pep. No. Not tackles. The backlash and the backlash against the backlash have followed. Letâs face it, elements of English football have been desperate for a chance to portray Guardiola as effete and entitled, for our own muscular island league to âfind him outâ in some decisive fashion. If you believe what you read, Sunday afternoon canât come quickly enough for Arsenal, who have finally found a team they can kick off the park, an Arsenal all of their own. This time, finally, they get to be Gary Neville. An equally pointed response has followed from those more sympathetic to the methods of a coach whose fingerprints are all over the outstanding club football achievements of the last decade. There is a little of the old reflexive fear of abroad here. Jozef Venglos, the first genuine overseas manager in England, was condemned 25 years ago for his refusal to shout loudly enough at his Aston Villa players. The end came shortly after Venglos banned the drinking of tea during training. With this in mind, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger will perhaps have a little sympathy for his opposite number. Wenger was also an alien interloper in his time, although not quite with the same    intensity. Guardiola, unashamedly academic, preposterously   openly hostile to the dominant culture, is perhaps the least English   manager ever to visit these shores. Not to mention a presence that tends to chafe with his   his army of converts and zealots. Lo, he is come. To deliver us into the light. The truth is somewhere in between. For a start Pep was right. He does not coach tackles. His Barcelona crop of 2010â11, the most notable club team of the last 20 years, finished 19th out of 20 in La Ligaâs tackle league. Anyone who watched them press and hog the ball knows they still left the opposition battered and drained. Xavi, the best midfielder in the world at the time, was the 285th most prolific in terms of tackles in the division, making 32 all season. There are more ways to strangle an opponent than simply putting your hands around his neck. The Leicester game was fascinating for other reasons. More worrying for City is the fact Leicester   rather than   them, scoring four excellent goals while having only 22% possession and 371 touches to Cityâs 903. Pablo Zabaleta touched the ball 106 times and had 96% pass completion but still spent the first half looking utterly confused in a strange false 2 role. Riyad Mahrez made only 17 passes and in effect decided the match. These are the details that will concern Guardiola. City lost because their execution was poor. Not because they did not tackle but because they did not pass like Mahrez or finish like Jamie Vardy. The problem was not too much    . It was not enough of it. Plus, of course, some obvious, rather conventional failings of personnel and positioning. Under pressure, holes have appeared. Since the bruising   draw with Celtic, City have lost all four of their domestic matches against teams in the top seven by a combined score of  . Guardiola himself has been oddly vague in places. It seems fair to ask how, given his contacts at City, and given Joe Hartâs very public   career, it took Guardiola until after the season had started to decide he needed to source another goalkeeper. Claudio Bravo may or may not be a     but Guardiola has hardly given him a fair shot, signing him on 25 August and depriving him of a   in his new team, some privacy to make mistakes and settle. For a master of detail, a man who never sleeps, brain always whirring like a chess computer, this seems a very rushed piece of major surgery. City also managed to spend Â£115m in the summer on players they do not really need right now: two insideâforwards, a   sweeperâkeeper and an apprentice   centreâhalf. OK, fine. But you forgot the   and the   backup for Vincent Kompany and Sergio AgÃ¼ero. Obvious holes remain, holes that Pep,   obsessive, must surely have noticed. Instead, a system has been plastered across the available personnel with all the attendant wrinkles and snags. Guardiola has some more everyday problems for Sunday. The absence of AgÃ¼ero will once again dull Cityâs attacking edge. Fernandinho has been a vital cog but is likewise still suspended. The injured Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan will be hugely missed. Beyond this City are simply a streaky team generally. This is the seventh season since the good times started to roll and each has brought a sticky run at some point. This time last year City won seven times in 15 games. The year before it was four in 15 from the end of January. There is still a jumpiness, a need to drive this team on from within that has in the past come from Kompany or Yaya TourÃ©. Guardiolaâs defence will concern him, too.   or   City had not kept a clean sheet in eight games before Watford in midweek. Rather than bringing the expected fluidity and verve, the endless subtle changes and tinkering seem to have furred the arteries. City are yet to play the same midfield shape and personnel in two successive matches. At times it has looked a little too much to take on the hoof. This is the dilemma Guardiola faces in   a familiar test of principle for a genuine, often infuriating footballing aesthete. It seems fair to say that had Hart played the past 14 games and Cityâs summer budget been spent on a solid   and two fullâbacks then they might be top of the league. But they would also be essentially the same team, further away than they are now from a state of total Pep, that coherent, fluid, possessionâbased bundle of Guardiolaâspec parts that is the ultimate goal. Hence the jarring insistence on applauding players who make mistakes, most notably the   Stones axis, who even when they play poorly, play poorly   and are therefore still part of the process. Stones has given the ball away more than any other regular central defender in the league. But he has also carried the ball forward more times over 90 minutes than any other defender in Europe, an indication of progress perhaps, but above all of a principle taken on board. Win or lose against Arsenal, Guardiola will maintain the time he really starts to fail is not when players make mistakes learning the system but when he abandons it for a compromise. Arsenal will press relentlessly at that tender central defence. For once Wengerâs team approach this fixture as insiders, a settled domestic force ready to offer another test of Premier League virtues. It promises, as ever with this evolving Project Pep, to be a fascinating spectacle.","Given that itâs supposed to be giving us fleeting, tantalising glimpses of the nebulous future, Hollywood   is often surprisingly conservative. The new Alien movie features a gay couple among its crew of colonists to another world, while there was plenty of discussion over producersâ decision to give Sulu a male partner in last yearâs Star Trek: Beyond. And yet both these examples are really only newsworthy because itâs so rare that we see anyone in space at all (certainly in mainstream cinema) whoâs not heterosexual. Star Wars fans hoping to see queer representation in the   saga have picked up on a few moments of intimacy between John Boyegaâs Finn and Oscar Isaacâs Poe Dameron in The Force Awakens as evidence for a relationship. And thereâs little wrong with that, except that it does seem to be an example of extreme wishful thinking. But it might be worth noting that a full 20 years ago, Luc Bessonâs The Fifth Element gave us a hero so outrageously unorthodox  â   on both a gender and sexuality level  â   that it makes Hollywoodâs current gentle tilt towards a more diverse depiction of humanityâs future look pretty weak in comparison. In Ruby Rhod, played with   thrusting sexuality by the young Chris Tucker, the frenetic   romp presented us with a hero of rare queer vitality, more than two decades before fans begged Marvel to give Captain America a boyfriend. Decked out in extravagant   Gaultier outfits, and spending most of the movie either squealing in   horror at the sight of aliens taking over an luxury intergalactic cruise ship or luring   space vixens into virtual orgasms merely by his presence, Rhod is a character whose rejection of gender norms is so elevated that they seem to have arrived through a wormhole from the year 3000, never mind 2263 (The Fifth Elementâs ostensible time frame). At one point Tucker chooses to be called âMissâ Ruby, and yet there is a definite hint of phallicism in that rock star surname. Moreover, Rhod appears to be the very definition of   masculinity. Is it any wonder that Prince was the model for the role, with Tucker only recruited once it became clear the purple one was not going to sign on the dotted line? How ahead of his time was Besson here? Is Rhod the  âs vision of a society so comfortable in its own skin that gender roles have slowly melted away, or merely a reflection of the directorâs nutty, French comic     leanings, a progressive pearl formed entirely by kind happenstance? Does the talkshow hostâs apparent heterosexuality undermine the bravery of the characterâs inclusion, or add to the sense that societies of the future might not really care who their heroes love, nor how they define themselves, provided they rock a     jumpsuit like it was designed for them at a genetic level? The inclusion of Rhod is hardly Bessonâs only outrageous call in The Fifth Element. We should not forget that the Frenchman also gives us a female Christ figure in Milla Jovovichâs title character  â   described throughout as a supreme being and âsaviourâ. And yet thereâs an argument to be made that these unorthodox characters only stand out so much precisely because Bessonâs space epic is otherwise so crushingly conservative.  The real hero of The Fifth Element is Bruce Willisâs Korben Dallas, a   white guy with a military background whoâs called in to save the world from a giant black planet of fire and death, despite the fact that Jovovich has just been hyped up as the answer to all humanityâs prayers. Itâs Dallas who rescues her after sheâs blown half to bits by Gary Oldmanâs scheming Zorg Dallas who finds the other four elements by digging them out of an alien singerâs stomach and Dallas who works out how to unleash all five elements to destroy the black whirling planet of doom just before it hits the Earth. For good measure, he then gets to have sex with female space Jesus as the credits roll, rather in the style of 60s James Bond. Other aspects of The Fifth Element are far more problematic, from the filmâs depiction of wanton identikit flight attendants,   future McDonalds waitresses and Dallasâs unseen mother, whoâs constantly calling him up for a nag. It seems that this is a future largely populated by brainless space bimbos and stereotypes of   women. It doesnât help that (apart from Jovovich) pretty much everyone in a position of power, from Tom Lister Jrâs president to Brion Jamesâ General Munroe, is a man. But perhaps itâs unfair to judge Bessonâs film according to progressive mores in 2017.

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Swimmer Michael Phelps is the most prominent athlete to appear with circular bruises over his body this week, raising eyebrows and questions. Is he okay? Is he a closet hemophiliac? Is he â  oh no â  heâs not smoking pot again? Olympians are now allowed a modest amount of THC in blood tests, so he might be. But that would only tangentially explain the bruises, which are   the result of a practice known as cupping. The process involves small, glass cups that look like shot glasses with nipples being placed over his skin, and a practitioner then inducing a vacuum inside the cup by heating the air. That suction pulls his skin up into the cup, breaking capillaries and causing blood to pool and stagnate, creating a bruise. Thatâs why the process is also known as âfire cuppingâ and âsucking method. â A     search will show you some horrendously purple injuries. Phelpsâs are relatively minor. He and some other athletes undertake them because they believe this process helps muscles to heal more quickly by encouraging blood flow. A bruise is a blood clot, though, and clotted blood is definitionally not flowing. So in terms of   behavior, cupping may be more deleterious than a grainy bong photo, because it invites people to distrust science. What takes this      from psychopathology to hip trend is the fact of it being an âancient Chinese therapy. â Those arenât dismissive, skeptical quotations â  people in China have indeed been doing it for centuries, as a therapeutic pursuit â  just a restatement of the common buzz phrase that is integral to the appeal of the practice. Something about the oldness, and the    gives it some enduring   cred. And itâs always fraught to criticize a practice thatâs so historically intwined with a particular culture so that the two become inseparable. Denying the efficacy of a health intervention is denying a part of someoneâs identity. But here I am. Because I also donât like seeing people waste money when they donât know theyâre wasting money. Beliefs about how cupping benefits a person are multitudinous, limited only by the imagination. And, in terms of scientific evidence, substantiated only by the imagination. Cupping has not been studied in large, controlled clinical trials. Part of that is because it would be difficult to have a control group. If youâve been cupped, you know it. (Hence the meme âQuit cupping me, bro. â Ed: Not an actual meme.) Placebo effects can be strong, especially in domains as psychologically dependent as   athletics. Studies arenât especially important to the practitioners who sell cupping, anyway, because the industry that profits from cupping in the United States â  the enormous âalternativeâ medicine industry â  defines itself as one that does not deal in evidence. A lack of evidence rather paradoxically makes some practices more appealing to those who are seeking answers outside of the health care system. Things like cupping, cryotherapy, chelation, and IV nutrient therapy sell in this space not despite the fact that they arenât proven to work, but because of it. These practices have much in common with the political ascent of Donald Trump, who is appealing to many because of his inexperience and lack of traditional leadership qualities and characteristics. Such reactionary appeal will persist in health as in politics, in the face of any contrary evidence, and despite the lack of a plausible mechanism. With the most decorated Olympian in history serving as some   swimming billboard for cupping, I donât expect anything I can say will stem the coming tide. And I also donât want to feed the forbidden fruit appeal. So the bottom line might be this: If you have the disposable time and money, and cupping makes you feel good, and itâs not undertaken at the expense of any   health endeavors, and you donât have any blood clotting disorders or any other medical contraindication, itâs probably not going to hurt you in any way other than the pain it causes.","A former physicianâs assistant at Rikers Island has been hit with rape and other sex abuse charges for trading sex with inmates for fast food and other favors. Sidney Wilson was slapped with a   indictment for various sex acts with four female inmates between Oct. 2013 and Dec. 2014. The    who left his job in 2015, is accused of exchanging sex for things like gum, socks, and the occasional bite of fast food. An incarcerated person is incapable of consenting to sex while in the custody of a correctional facility, according to the Bronx DAâs office.

Since then Gore has become increasingly less active in electoral politics and more active in environmental causes, sharing the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for that effort.

The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal, authored by Rep. Sean Maloney ( . Y.) appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a    vote. Outraged Democrats shouted âshameâ and accused Republican leaders of abusing chamber rules by holding the vote open until they could twist enough arms to kill the amendment.   How can a 2 min vote become an 8 min vote? When you need to work for 6 mins to keep discriminating vs #LGBT. Watch: https:  .   â   Jim Himes (@jahimes) May 19, 2016  âThey literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality,â Maloney said. âWe won this vote. â Maloney told reporters that when he saw House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) âpersonally twisting arms on the floor,â he asked him to let the vote conclude only to be told to âto get back on my own sideâ of the aisle. In protest, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( .) took to the microphone to rail against Republicans as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) walked around the Democratsâ side of the floor waving a red vote card and urging her members to vote no on the underlying military construction and veterans programs spending bill so that Republicans âget the message. â The spending bill subsequently was passed on a    vote, with 57 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. The House fracas comes as a national debate is underway over LGBT rights. The battle has reached a fever pitch in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a measure to ban transgender individuals from using a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. Corporations boycotted the state after the measure was enacted, and the federal government and North Carolina have now slapped competing lawsuits against each other. [North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights] Tensions over the issue in the House surfaced in recent weeks when a provision was added to the annual defense policy bill by Rep. Steve Russell ( .) that would exempt religious organizations that contract with the federal government from certain parts of civil rights law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Democrats and some moderate Republicans decried the proposal, but earlier this week GOP leaders blocked them from holding a vote to strip the language from the defense bill when it was on the floor. The battle then moved to Thursday when the chamber considered one of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which historically have been allowed to have a more   amendment process. The vote on Thursday is just one chapter in a fight that promises to occupy Congress in the coming weeks as both Republicans and Democrats plan further legislative measures to force the House to take a stand on the divide over whether certain policies, such as those concerning hiring practices and public bathrooms, amount to LGBT discrimination or protections for freedom of religion. When and where the fight will be waged remains murky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) on Thursday declined to say whether Republicans would bring up measures to curtail the Obama administrationâs efforts on LGBT rights, which include his recent directive to schools to accommodate transgender students in the bathrooms of their choosing. Ryan told reporters only that that such matters âshould be left up to the states. â But Ryan âis engaged in understandingâ how the House will try to push back on the transgender bathrooms issue, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( ) said. âWeâve encouraged him, Iâve encouraged him, heâs been encouraged,â he added. One option may be a new bill from Rep. Luke Messer ( .) which seeks to block President Obamaâs executive order on transgender bathrooms by preventing the administration from withholding federal funding from schools that donât comply with the order. Messer said Thursday he is looking for   vehicles as potential avenues for the legislation, such as appropriations bills. âI can assure you weâll try to do something in appropriations on this issue for sure,â said Rep. Tom Cole ( .) a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and a close ally of its chairman and the Speaker. According to a new   poll, the country is divided almost evenly with 46 percent of all people answering that transgender people should use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they were born and 41 percent believing they should use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify. There is a stark partisan divide, however:   of Republicans and 66 percent conservatives say that transgender people should use the restroom corresponding to their gender at birth, while 60 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of liberals say they should be able to use the restroom with which they identify. As Republicans cue up measures to push back on the presidentâs   orders, Democrats said to exploit any divisions within the GOP  â   or short of that, expose them. âThese things are going to be remembered,â Maloney said of the Republicans who switched their votes, likening the act to being on âthe wrong side of the march toward Selmaâ and âstanding in the schoolhouse doorâ to prevent the integration of schools. He said these lawmakers would âhave this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers. â"," The United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and the European Union have written to China to express concern over three new or planned laws, including one on counterterrorism, in a rare joint bid to pressure Beijing into taking their objections seriously. The U. S. Canadian, German and Japanese ambassadors signed a letter dated Jan. 27 addressed to State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun, voicing unease about the new counterterrorism law, the draft cyber security law, and a draft law on management of foreign   organizations (NGOs). In what sources said was a coordinated move, the ambassador of the European Union Delegation to China, Hans Dietmar Schweisgut, sent a letter expressing similar concerns, dated Jan. 28. Reuters reviewed copies of both letters. The cyber security and counterterrorism laws codify sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats, from widespread censorship to heightened control over certain technologies. Critics of the counterterrorism legislation, for one, say that it could be interpreted in such a way that even   dissidents could fall within its definition of terrorism. The four ambassadors said areas of the counterterrorism law, which the National Peopleâs Congress passed in December, were vague and could create a âclimate of uncertaintyâ among investors. They did not specify which areas. The EU ambassador used the same phrase to describe the lawâs impact, and both letters expressed an interest in engaging with China as it worked out implementing regulations around the law, to try to mitigate those concerns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, asked about the letters, said all countries were enhancing their efforts to combat terrorism, and that he hoped other countries would respect Chinaâs sovereignty. âThe counterterrorism law will not affect relevant businessesâ normal operations and it will not affect relevant personnelâs legitimate interests,â he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Guo could not be reached for comment. Chinaâs State Council Information Office and Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment. While countries often give feedback on proposed legislation in China, the rare joint response by several major powers, and coordination with the EU, signals an increased readiness to lend weight of numbers to their argument. It also points to growing frustration that the   individual approach taken in the past may not be working. âWhile we recognize the need for each country to address its security concerns, we believe the new legislative measures have the potential to impede commerce, stifle innovation, and infringe on Chinaâs obligation to protect human rights in accordance with international law,â said a   letter   by the four ambassadors. China has defended the new and draft laws, saying such steps, including heightened censorship, were necessary to ensure stability in the country of over 1. 3 billion people. âCLIMATE OF UNCERTAINTYâ The diplomatic push comes as Beijing arguably needs cooperation from the signatories to the letters more than ever. A slowing Chinese economy and fragile markets highlight the importance of foreign investorsâ confidence. Chinese companies are increasingly looking to get approvals from foreign governments for acquisitions, and the European Union is debating whether to give China âmarket economyâ status. On the draft cyber security law, all five ambassadors were particularly concerned by provisions requiring companies to store data locally and to provide encryption keys, which technology firms worried may impinge on privacy and mean they would have to pass on sensitive intellectual property to the government in the name of security. Both letters said the draft NGO management law had the potential to hinder academic exchanges and commercial activities, calling them âcrucial elementsâ of their relationships with China. Critics have said the draft legislation risked choking off NGOsâ work by requiring them to get official sponsors and giving broad powers to police to regulate their activities. In the letters, the ambassadors asked China to open both draft laws to another round of public consultations. The U. S. embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. A spokesman for the EU Delegation had no comment when reached by Reuters. The German embassy declined to comment on the letter. The Japanese embassy said: âWe pay attention to Chinese movement over relevant laws or drafts of laws.â  A Canadian government spokesperson said Canada had expressed its concerns to Chinaâs government âabout a number of new laws and regulations that constrain civil society and hinder access to information. âWe have expressed these concerns through a variety of different approaches and will continue to raise these with the Chinese government,â the spokesperson added. The parties to the letters decided to express their concerns together after it became unclear to what degree China was taking their individual input on the laws on board, said a person with knowledge of the matter. âWeâre trying to avoid the divide and conquer approach (by China). They like to do that on any possible occasion. We wanted to send a   that when we have shared interests, we cannot so easily be split,â the person said, adding that there had been no clear response by China so far to the letters. âWe donât plan to establish a   relationship. We want something to happen.â  (Additional reporting by Michael Martina, Megha Rajagopalan and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Mike  ) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a âdeclaration of warâ which could trigger clashes within days. WASHINGTON U. S. President Donald Trump will get a chance to patch up   ties this week when he meets with NATO allies still rattled by his failure on an earlier trip to embrace the principle that an attack against one member is an attack against all. ","Donald Trumpâs campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trumpâs use of funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts, telling CNNâs Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesnât take money as a salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trumpâs to give away. âYou know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trumpâs money,â Conway said, neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation since 2008. âThe Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in. â Donald Trumpâs campaign manager has only the utmost respect for former president George HW Bush, whose age she mentioned casually while discussing his alleged plan to vote for Hillary Clinton: Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that âour   communities are in the worst shape theyâve ever been . .. Ever. Ever. Ever. â The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage. A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. âImmigration security is national security,â he said, and repeatedly read the lyrics of the The Snake, a 1960s soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the consequences of the United States taking in refugees. The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as âthe vessel for all the global special interests seeking to run our livesâ and said that the âfailed political establishmentâ had âvestedâ in her âall of their money, all of their hopes for another generation of corruptionâ. Trump also argued that the âdishonest mediaâ had âbled this country dryâ. But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that the billionaire converted $258, 000 in donations to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that could potentially even force the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by bragging on Tuesday about spending âOPM  â   other peopleâs moneyâ. Texas senator and former presidential contender Ted Cruz declined to say if he plans to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, again: Donald Trump called for a more rigorous immigration policy following the arrest of an American man born in Afghanistan for bombing attacks in New York and New Jersey this weekend. The Republican presidential nominee spoke to supporters at High Point University in North Carolina today and reiterated his vow to build a wall on the   border. Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâs campaign has filed its September Federal Election Commission report for the month of August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic parties, from more than 1. 1 million contributions, with an average contribution of $50. The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank. âThe millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot,â campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. âWith voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to vote. â More than 60% of the campaignâs August contributions were from women, and roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200. The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began August. Donald Trumpâs latest comments maybe needs a  : Our African American communities are in the worse shape theyâve ever been. Ever. Ever. Ever. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, itâs relevant reading:  I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America. Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?â But in America, people said: âWe are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you become a citizen?â America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable. With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow Americaâs example and work together to do more to support refugees. ... When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, itâs important that President Obama is setting this example. When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country. Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again. Fox News talking head Sean Hannityâs outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an   promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance. Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to soak up each othersâ awesomeness, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee: One of the reasons Iâm supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, heâs going to put originalists on the supreme court   people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers,   branches of government. Heâs a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe. And, of course, heâs gonna build that wall. He says heâs gonna have Mexico pay for it. Thatâs fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we donât want people competing for jobs. He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us  . And as somebody whoâs been a marksman since Iâm 11 years old, protecting our Second Amendment rights are paramount to me. The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds. On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  â   the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of Robert F Kennedy  â   that he plans to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, CNN is reporting that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponentâs spouse: Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to Bush   an extraordinary rebuke of his own partyâs nominee.  Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former presidentâs plans on 8 November. âThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,â Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. âHe is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. â The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans spend talking about   racial metaphors that were once used by Nazi war criminals, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a âtremendous asset to the campaign. â Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump campaign, the Republican nomineeâs communications team has elected to double down on the statement. âDon Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,â wrote communications advisor Jason Miller in a statement. âAmerica has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clintonâs planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do whatâs needed to protect us. â The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir William Eden   used a very similar metaphor in an address to Parliament: Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that partook of it. The Nevada Republican party seems eager to focus on   races this year. .. Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to Buzzfeed News, but the    candidateâs campaign is still breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the movements of the Republican nominee. Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trumpâs motorcade, a break in   tradition that the campaign originally promised to maintain. âWe have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,â Trumpâs pool reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. âWe have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on Trumpâs plane so it is a truly protective pool. They have not been responsive to that request. â The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his campaign plane, instead opting for a âchaserâ plane that had led to delays for reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. (Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in time.)","   David Cole, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, is author of the new book âEngines of Liberty: The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law. â   Liberals are understandably excited, and conservatives equally concerned, that the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scaliaâs death may be filled by a Democratic president  â   with either Merrick Garland, President Obamaâs nominee, or Hillary Clintonâs nominee, should she win the election. The courtâs ideological majority lies in the balance.  The conservatives have had a long run. While control of the presidency and both houses of Congress has changed hands multiple times over the past 40 years, the Supreme Court has been dominated by a consistent majority of conservative justices since the 1970s, even as some Republican appointees, such as David Souter and Harry A. Blackmun, proved to be liberal. The court is now evenly divided, with four liberal and four conservative justices. With a liberal majority in the offing, a whole new world of possibilities awaits. Or does it? History suggests otherwise. The Supreme Court under Chief Justices Warren E. Burger, William H. Rehnquist and John G. Roberts Jr. has overruled relatively few liberal constitutional precedents. Despite strong invitations to do so, the court did not reverse Roe v. Wade (protecting the right to choose an abortion) or Miranda v. Arizona (requiring warnings and legal assistance in interrogations). It has not ended affirmative action or overturned decisions banning the public display of religious symbols. Even if Garland or some other Democratic nominee is confirmed, therefore, major changes in existing constitutional doctrine are unlikely. The force of precedent imposes significant limits on the courtâs ability to change direction, even when its personnel change. Major transformations of constitutional law do occur, but they require much more than a new justice. They generally follow decades of persistent advocacy in a variety of forums, primarily outside the Supreme Court. The court is much more likely to recognize constitutional change than to generate it. And it tends to do so slowly, only after the ground of public opinion and state law has already shifted. Constitutional law changes incrementally, from the ground up, not suddenly, from the top down.    Four cases that could   the country will be heard when the Supreme Court meets this term without Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia consistently expressed conservative views when reviewing court cases. (Claritza   Washington Post)    Brown v. Board of Education,  which said segregated schools violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, came only after a   campaign by civil rights lawyers and activists. The court first recognized sex discrimination as a violation of equal protection only after the womenâs movement had transformed understandings of womenâs roles in society more generally. While some have criticized it as premature, the decision in Roe to protect a womanâs right to choose abortion similarly followed a political campaign for reproductive rights. The courtâs 2008 ruling that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms is attributable to three decades of concerted work by the National Rifle Association and its allies to develop and propagate the idea of a right to bear arms in other forums, including state legislatures, state courts, the political arena and the legal academy. The same is true for the newest constitutional right  â   of gay men and lesbian couples to marry on the same terms as heterosexual couples. In 1972, the court unanimously ruled that a petition arguing that the Constitution requires recognition of   marriage did not even present a serious legal question; it dismissed the petition with one line. Yet last year, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the court recognized a constitutional right to marriage equality. That remarkable shift cannot be explained by changed personnel. The court in 2015 was, if anything, more conservative than the court in 1972. Rather, one must look at the work that gay rights groups did in a wide variety of forums beyond the federal courts to change public opinion about the status of gay men and lesbians, and about the justice of their desire to marry. The Supreme Court did not so much change constitutional law on marriage equality as acknowledge that it had changed. Constitutional law will continue to develop in the   era. But the changes will come more from the sustained work of committed citizens than from the appointment of a new justice. Over the course of our history, the true catalysts of constitutional evolution have been not the justices  â   although they obviously play a necessary part  â   but the people, working together through civil society to make their own shared vision of constitutional ideals into law. Constitutional law reflects what we as a society deem to be our most fundamental values, and those values evolve. But in the most important sense, the impetus for change comes from us, not from the men and women who serve as justices of the Supreme Court.   Read more about this topic:   Richard A.

But now, with Cold War intrigue hotter than itâs been in decades, many curious new viewers are likely to flock to this series. At first, they may be quite surprised, because The Americans, more than anything else, is a family drama, in which the parents just happen to be Russian spies living in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC. The husband and wife, Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, were paired by mother Russia long ago to emigrate to the United States and have a couple of kids and run a small travel agency, while taking on serious and sometimes dangerous spy missions. Their kids are now teens, and their daughter Paige is old enough to ask questions, and notice and challenge things. Sheâs also embarked on a budding romance with the teen son of the   neighbor  â   who just happens to be an FBI agent investigating spies just like his seemingly innocent   neighbors. Elizabeth and Philip are played by Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, who are wonderful. The couple adopts various identities and disguises to spy for their homeland  â   sometimes together, other times alone. Based on the three episodes available for preview, the season features an overarching story about a possible U. S. plot to damage the Soviet wheat crops. But what really counts on The Americans, as always, are the dynamics within this quiet family suburb. As the season opens, mom Elizabeth introduces the teenage Paige to the real family business. Will Paige mature quickly enough to join her parents on a spy mission? And if so, how will that go? And the FBI agent has to learn, eventually, that the object of his investigation has been a trusted confidant the whole time  â   leading to the same sort of emotional climax as the one between Walter White and his    Hank on Breaking Bad.  These underlying tensions, between neighbors, and between children and parents, are what makes The Americans so quietly intense  â   and so interesting. Itâs also interesting to reflect how televisionâs depictions of Cold War tensions have changed over the decades. In the â60s, our mistrust of the Soviets was embodied by Boris Badenov, a scheming spy, along with his partner Natasha Fatale, for the fictional foreign country of Pottsylvania on the cartoon series Rocky  Bullwinkle. The American response to these foreign operatives, on TV, was the Mission: Impossible force, a U. S. spy operation so   that every mission began with a warning that the government, if confronted, would deny its existence. American TV viewers, in the 1960s, had no problem with that. But by the 1980s, the time frame in which The Americans is set, the concerns, and the paranoia, was heightened. ABC gave us 1983âs The Day After, a frightening   about a Russian nuclear missile attack on the American heartland  â   specifically, Lawrence, Kansas. ABC also gave us a 1987 miniseries called Amerika. It was set in the near future, and depicted life in the U. S. after the Soviets had succeeded in mounting a bloodless coup, with the President being a mere pawn for his Russian manipulators. Quite fittingly, an episode of The Americans, a few seasons ago, was all about the reactions of the various characters on that show, who were watching the 1983 premiere of The Day After. Its politics, and its power and topicality, got their attention then  â   just as FXâs The Americans deserves your attention now.","BjÃ¶rk has written an open letter addressing the sexism she claims to have received, stating that female artists are criticised if they âdonât cut our chest open and bleed about the men in our livesâ. The Icelandic artist took to her Facebook page to post the letter, which began with her stating that in her career she hasnât âmoaned about sexism and just got on w itâ but her recent experience at the Day and Night festival in Houston  â   where she performed a DJ set  â   triggered the response.  âI am aware of that it is less of a year since I started djing publicly so this is something people are still getting used to and my fans have been incredibly welcoming to me sharing my musical journey and letting me be me,â she wrote. âBut some media could not get their head around that I was not âperformingâ and âhidingâ behind desks, and my male counterparts not. And I think this is sexism. â She added that male performers at the festival including  â   Aphex Twin, Matmos and her former collaborator Arca  â   played similar sets, but didnât get the same critique. BjÃ¶rk went on to deliver a more general comment on the way female artists who tackle subjects that are not connected to their romantic relationships with men are treated by the media. âWomen in music are allowed to be singer songwriters singing about their boyfriends,â she wrote.  âIf they change the subject matter to atoms, galaxies, activism, nerdy math beat editing or anything else than being performers singing about their loved ones they get criticized. Journalists feel there is just something missing   â¦     as if our only lingo is emo   â¦    â She added that this happened with her two last albums. âOn the pedagogic Biophilia I sang about galaxies and atoms, but it wasnât until Vulnicura where I shared a heartbreak I got full acceptance from the media. â âIf we donât cut our chest open and bleed about the men and children in our lives we are cheating our audience. Eat your Bechdel test heart out. â BjÃ¶rk has spoken about the sexism sheâs faced in the music industry before around the release of her Vulnicura album in January 2015. âAfter being the only girl in bands for 10 years, I learned  â   the hard way  â   that if I was going to get my ideas through, I was going to have to pretend that they  â   men  â   had the ideas,â she told Pitchfork. She also spoke of the struggle for her to get creative credit for her work, after she found that her male collaborators were often written about as being the driving force behind her innovation.","A day after a suspected chemical weapons strike in Syria killed more than 70 people, world powers are trading accusations and denials as investigations into the attack continue. Experts are still evaluating exactly what happened, but thereâs widespread consensus that deadly chemicals were involved in the attack on Khan Shaykhun in Idlib province. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that 72 people there were killed by toxic chemicals, including 20 children and 17 women. The World Health Organization has also received reports of scores of fatalities from deadly chemicals. âAccording to Health Cluster partners on the ground treating the patients, at least 70 people have died and hundreds more have been affected,â the WHO wrote. âOpposition activist videos show rescue workers hosing down survivors and the bodies of purported victims, showing no outward wounds,â NPRâs Alison Meuse reports from Beirut. âIn one video, nine   children are loaded in the back of a truck, staring lifelessly into space.â Itâs not entirely confirmed what the chemicals were, but experts suspect a powerful nerve agent. Doctors Without Borders says victims were showing symptoms consistent with a chemical âsuch as sarin gas or similar compounds.â In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs attack, international leaders  â   including British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and President Trump  â   censured Bashar Assadâs regime for the apparent use of chemical weapons against civilians. On Wednesday, Trump said the attack âcrossed a lot of lines with me.â âWhen you kill innocent children, innocent babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal, people were shocked to hear what gas it was, that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line, many, many lines,â Trump said, adding, âThese heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated.â At an emergency U. N. Security Council meeting Wednesday, U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley delivered a pointed message, saying that Russia and Iran âhave no interest in peaceâ and that the U. S. may need to act on its own. âWhen the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,â she said. Envoys from Russia had a different response to the attack. âThe main task now is to have an objective inquiry into what happened,â Russiaâs deputy U. N. ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told the Security Council, according to The Associated Press. âUp to now all falsified reports about this incident have come from the White Helmets or the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in London which have been discredited long ago.â Russia has an alternate narrative of events, as Charles Maynes reports for NPR from Moscow. âRussiaâs defense ministry says Syrian warplanes indeed carried out the strikes, but that civilian deaths were caused when those bombs struck a hidden ammunition depot that contained chemical weapons that belonged to terrorist groups on the ground,â Maynes says. âRussia maintains the Assad government destroyed its entire chemical arsenal under a deal Moscow brokered with the Obama administration back in 2013.â That explanation has been challenged as âcompletely unsustainable and completely untrueâ by a British chemical weapons expert who spoke to the BBC. âAxiomatically, if you blow up Sarin, you destroy it,â he told the BBC. This   is not new in the Syrian conflict. In 2013, hundreds of civilians died in an attack on a Damascus suburb that used sarin gas. Afterward, the regime and its Russian allies claimed that rebel fighters may have used the chemical weapons. The Obama administration quickly rejected that explanation. A U. N. inspection confirmed the use of weapons, but did not attribute any blame. The use of chemical weapons is a war crime, prohibited under a number of international treaties. In 2013, after the sarin attack on Damascus, Assadâs government agreed to hand over all of its remaining chemical weapons stockpile. But in the last month alone, chemical weapons have been reportedly used at in Syria least three times, according to NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Ongoing investigations might confirm the type of weapon used Tuesday and who deployed it. But key questions will still remain  â   including where the weapons came from, and how the world will respond.","The first Democrat and first woman to serve as Pennsylvania attorney general was sentenced to jail on Monday, completing a catastrophic fall from grace for a rising political star.  Former Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane, once seen as a potential future governor, was convicted in August of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She resigned from her position two days later, having served since 2013. Kane was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in jail and eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kaneâs ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law. If Kane posts bond of $75, 000 cash bail, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction. The jury at her criminal trial in August found her guilty of illegally leaking grand jury findings to the press to embarrass a political enemy. She then plotted a   and lied about it under oath. Kane, 50, was convicted of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She resigned from her position two days later, having served since 2013. Looking back at her swift downfall, Bruce Ledewitz, a law professor at Pittsburghâs Duquesne University said: âThis illustrates once more, if anyone ever needed reminding, that the   is worse than the crime. â Kane could initially have gotten away with a slap on the wrist for the leak itself, he told the Guardian. âThe grand jury leak would have been a minor embarrassment if she had gone to court and apologized. But instead she started covering up,â he said. Kaneâs short reign was one of paradox. She became known for standing up for victims of sexual violence and defending gay rights. And she took on a state criminal justice establishment she called the âold boysâ clubâ including a crackdown after racist, sexist and pornographic emails were discovered being swapped on government computers. But she also developed a reputation for grandiosity,   and   some observers noted. âHer fall has been shocking. There was nothing on her track record to suggest that she was going to become corrupted by power. She came into that office as Bambi and turned into Richard Nixon overnight  â   seeking to get even with political foe,â Ledewitz said. Judge Wendy   said during sentencing that Kane assumed an âoff with your headsâ mentality as she ran the stateâs top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political âneophyteâ who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office. âThis case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant . .. felt had embarrassed her in the press,â   said. Kane campaigned for office pledging to investigate whether Republicans were dragging out the slow process of indicting Jerry Sandusky, for political reasons. The former Penn State football coach was eventually convicted in 2012, found guilty of 45 counts of abusing young boys after a long grand jury probe had found crimes going back decades. No politically motivated delays in the case were ever proved, but Kane became embroiled in feuds with Republican governor Tom Corbett, Sandusky prosecutor Frank Fina and others. Fina ended up being the main target of the leak that sunk Kane. Over a relatively short period, her leadership became marred by vendettas, lawsuits and leaks.   attorney Walter Cohen, a former attorney general, said Kaneâs motives were often just but her execution was   and her style became grandiose. âShe started to believe all the great things people were saying about her and believed she was indestructible,â Cohen said. Kane came under investigation in 2014. But even as the perjury case was closing in on her, her team was working hard behind the scenes on a secret grand jury investigation into pedophile priests. In the spring of 2016, Kane released a report exposing decades of âmonstrousâ child abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the Pennsylvania archdiocese of  . A series of other Pennsylvania archdioceses are now similarly under investigation. Meanwhile Kane encouraged state lawmakersâ attempts to lift the statute of limitations so that more victims of child abuse could sue the church, despite those efforts being repeatedly thwarted by pushback from Catholic leaders. In 2015, Kaneâs law license was suspended and she was charged by Montgomery County district attorney Kevin Steele, the same prosecutor who indicted Bill Cosby for sexual assault. Ironically, with her trial looming in 2016, Kane hired a Republican prosecutor, Bruce Castor, to, essentially, stand in for her. He was best known for declining to prosecute Bill Cosby a decade ago and was perceived by some as acting against the interests of victims of sexual violence. Castor left shortly after Kaneâs conviction. A new attorney general will be elected in November. The race, reportedly, has been lacking in drama. âThatâs not a bad thing,â Ledewitz said. With reporting from the Associated Press.","     VANCOUVER  â   Want to live longer, enjoy life more and actually find that elusive happiness? Among the dozens of big ideas shared this week at the international TED conference  â   from a robot that could outperform students on college exams to an ultraviolet light that could kill superbugs  â   were some simpler, almost obvious, life improvements we should all prioritize to live better lives. While the ideas themselves might not be all that surprising, the explanations for how and why they better your life served as powerful reminders that we might be prioritizing the wrong things, and undervaluing that which makes life worth living.     social interaction leads to a longer life  Smoking, drinking, exercise and even heart problems are not predictors of a personâs longevity  â   a personâs close relationships and social integration were. Thatâs what psychologist Susan Pinker has discovered in researching the impact that our human connections have on all aspects of our   including our physical health. Those with intimacy in their lives, those with support systems and frequent    interactions were not only physically and emotionally healthier, but they also lived longer. Itâs why women, who tend to prioritize spending time with their friends more than men,  live an average of six years longer, Pinker said. And itâs not enough to text or email. The actual health benefits of socializing are only achieved through   contact, she said. â   contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters and, like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present and well into the future,â she said. And it doesnât even have to be long, close interactions to have an immediate effect. Making eye contact, shaking someoneâs hand, giving someone a   lowers your cortisone levels and releases dopamine, making you less stressed and giving you a little high, she said. Pinker showed two images of the brain, one of someone conversing in person and another of someone watching a video of someone discussing the same subject. In the brain of the person interacting, parts of the brain associated with social intelligence and emotional reward lit up. âThis    contact provides stunning benefits, but a quarter of the population says they have no one to talk to,â Pinker said. âWe can do something about this. Itâs a biological imperative to know we belong.   â¦     Building   interactions into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas, bolsters our immune system, sends positive hormones surging through our bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it is a matter of life or death. â    Adam Alter speaks at TED2017  â   The Future You, April   2017, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Bret  )   Knowing when to turn off your smartphone enriches your life  Adam Alter, professor of marketing and psychology, told a room full of some of the most successful entrepreneurs, scientists and tech innovators in the world about a German company that gives employees the option to set their    response when theyâre on vacation to tell the sender that their email will never be seen because itâs automatically deleted. The sender can email when the person is back from vacation, or, if itâs a work emergency, contact someone else at the office. The TED audience burst into applause. Alter has studied the impact all that screen time is having on our lives. People who spend time on social networks, dating apps and even online news sites reported being less happy. But the technology has taken away what Alter calls our âstopping cues. â Most things we do for pleasure, like reading a book or watching a movie, have an end. But scrolling on the phone is endless and we donât know when to break away. Using a bar graph to illustrate this, Alter showed that in 2007, technology took up a sliver of our precious personal time in a day. In 2017, it took up almost all of it. Alter found that those who did set finite rules for their technology use  â   like never using it at the dinner table or putting it on airplane mode when youâre out on the weekends (so you can access the camera but not the Internet)  â   were able to enjoy life more. âLife becomes more colorful, richer, you have better conversations, you connect with the person who is there with you,â he said.  Chasing meaning, not happiness, is what really matters  The quest for happiness doesnât make us happy. In fact, Emily Esfahani Smith realized, constantly evaluating our own happiness is actually contributing to feelings of hopelessness and depression. Happiness is a fickle emotion, fleeting, based on a moment or an experience. Whatâs really making us feel sad is not a lack of happiness, itâs lack of meaning, she said. Smith, author of the new book âThe Power of Meaning,â said that after five years of interviewing hundreds of people, she discovered that meaning can be derived in four forms: belonging, purpose, transcendence and storytelling. The first is exactly what it sounds like  â   having people in your life who truly love and care about you. The second is having purpose. Most people find purpose through work because itâs how we feel like weâre adding value or contributing. But, she said, âthat also means disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation, these arenât just economic problems, they are existential ones too. Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder. â So finding something to drive you forward, whether itâs work or something else, is a crucial slice of having meaning. Transcendence is about finding something that can take you outside of yourself, that can make you feel like youâre part of something bigger. For some thatâs art or church, she said. It could be walking in nature or doing yoga. With storytelling, thatâs all about our personal narratives. What is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves? âWeâre the author of our stories,â  she said, âand we can change how weâre telling them. Your life isnât just a list of events. â Read more Inspired Life from the TED conference: To solve our   problem, these TED speakers say we have to admit we donât know everything The world needs more humanity if itâs going to solve the refugee crisis, activists urge at TED conference How the traditionally apolitical TED Talks will navigate the unavoidable politics of 2017 Meet the    neuroscientist developing a drug to prevent depression and PTSD Pope Francis gives a surprise TED Talk, calls for a ârevolution of tendernessâ This Harvard doctor has a plan to save 30 million lives by 2030","After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of Americaâs most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job  â   slowing the   assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation. As the National Parks Service (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent. As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the countryâs history faces a daunting task. Americaâs grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures.  The Statue of Liberty is at âhigh exposureâ risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, could be eaten away by rising tides in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and may be beyond rescue.  These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing Americaâs landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.  âYosemiteâs famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,â fretted Barack Obama during a visit to the vast park in June.  âRising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park.  âRising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Thatâs not the America I want to pass on to the next generation. â Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS study from 2014 found four in five of Americaâs national parks are now at the âextreme endâ of temperature variables charted since 1901.  âWe are starting to see things spiral away now,â said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. âWe are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation. â There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react. If there is a front line, itâs probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth. Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The   coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that havenât burned in almost 5, 000 years. These trends imperil treasures such as those found in Cape Krusenstern national monument on the   coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9, 000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it. Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the   coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus  â   a type of half   knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast. âA lot of these sites havenât been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,â Devenport said. âYou can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses. âMost people havenât thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, itâs not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal. â The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of todayâs Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists.  âItâs a big problem,â Devenport acknowledged. âItâs probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50, 000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan.  âWhen that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. Youâve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used. â Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the  . Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in historic structures at TumacÃ¡cori national historical park in southern Arizona. The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of   clay. The NPS already devotes 2, 500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage. âFor the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the   US, losses are already rapidly occurring,â said the NPSâ Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue.  Meyer said there is a âgreat urgencyâ to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. âThe longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,â she said. Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve   sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on. Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2. 4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1. 5F)  â   but the trend is inexorably upwards. This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: âTug on anything at all and youâll find it connected to everything else in the universe. â Climate change is set to alter American forests as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms.  The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate.   species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name may not be able to adapt. Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves warming river waters will force out the salmon. âItâs hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,â said Schuurman.  âWe need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it. â A pressing question for the NPS is how these changes will go down with the public. Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the âexistentialâ threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin. Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean ânational parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with   facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nationâs remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land. â Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or  .  Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, according to one forecast. The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest. Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park wonât involve seeing any actual glaciers. âYes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,â said Schuurman. âWithout being blasÃ© in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss. â Temperature rise, Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2. 4F in the past century.  Disappearing snow and ice  The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the parkâs glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century. Sea level rise, Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS analysis calling it âone of the most obvious and most challenging impactsâ of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Wildfire, The wildfire season in the west is far lengthier than it was in the 1970s. The risk is compounded by shrinking snow abundance  â   in Yellowstone there is an average of 30 fewer days with snow on the ground compared to the 1960s."

The protesters who occupied Maidan, as the square is known, prepared for battle, stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013, after the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response, tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance.As the months passed, confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There, I photographed the fighters against a black curtain, a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire, ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here, I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history. With this realization, I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men, with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word ""costume"" because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment, irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves, this outward expression of masculinity, the ideal of the warrior.I worked slowly, using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old-fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February 20, which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers, loyal to the government, started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all, three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly, but celebration remained elusive in Maidan.As the days passed in Kiev's central square, streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people, filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before.I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day, my fixer, Emine, and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats, their shiny handbags, and the bunches of red carnations, white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there.It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are â not the way we look, but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict, not only in Maidan, and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior, then the women showed the implications of such violence.When I made these pictures, I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today, the death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan, the barricades have been dismantled, and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced, so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters, the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims, ""Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes."" Thank you. (Applause).","When we think of Nepal, we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas, the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes, or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills, where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener, there lives a great diversity of wildlife, including the one-horned rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately, these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals, battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks, but that is not an easy task, because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife.Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime, and these are drones, or more specifically, conservation drones. For about a year now, my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape, but it also allows you to capture detailed, high-resolution images of objects on the ground. This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential, not only for combating wildlife crime, but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations.So what is a drone? Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload, such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go.Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone, but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is, a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars.So now that you've built your own conservation drone, you probably want to go fly it, but how does one fly a drone? Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.So what can we do with a conservation drone? Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example, camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests, but these are motion-activated cameras, so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images, and that takes a lot of time, especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fiâenabled cameras.Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous, because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna, not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest.A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests.And finally, I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications.Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe, strongly believe, that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way, they are right. I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time, we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool, including drones, in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet.Thank you.(Applause)","(Music)Good afternoon.As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden.This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me: a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start, because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons, and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light. All of them are different colors, they're rippling with different frequencies, and they're bouncing off every surface, including me, and some of those are flying directly into your eyes, and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.Now a laser is different. It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye, you can use it to store massive amounts of data, and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent, but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency, an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero.Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction, so if you were to take the lid off that bottle, it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall, flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment, and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree, it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science: the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.But the experiment is not the end of the story, because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment, it seemed like the more he said, the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea, to really capture its essence, the fewer words you use, the better. In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking, my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words, scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly, it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for ""Dance Your Ph.D."" There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example, at the University of Minnesota, there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde, and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside, because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers, and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab, but before he does that, he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming, and when I visited David to learn about his research, he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy.(Laughter) (Applause)Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course, but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day. Now that assumes half-hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of 35,000 dollars, and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time, and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day, that would indeed add up to an annual waste of 100 billion dollars. Of course, that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool, and like any tool, it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA, it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence, the illusion of simplicity, and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example, our National Endowment for the Arts, with its $150 million budget, slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one-thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts, there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution, and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists, let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers. After all, they are the most perishable of their kind, prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds, we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help.Of course someday, in the deep future, a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented, rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However, I trust that by that day, we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. (Music) (Applause)","Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes. Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago. Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery. Do you know that surgery? Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty. Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it. But first you need to know two things about me. Just two things. I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids. Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?So my hip had been hurting me for years. I finally went to the doctor, which was free. And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free. Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting â almost a year. That is what free gets you. I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them. And you know, even I could tell my hip was bad, and I actually work in marketing. So he said, ""Allison, we've got to get you on the table. I'm going to replace your hip â it's about an 18-month wait."" 18 more months. I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. I would not have my new hip for TED2008. I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany. This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. Oh yeah.Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is? We do not think that way. We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians. ""After you."" ""Oh, no, no. After you."" Hey, are you from Canada? ""Oh, me too! Hi!"" ""Great! Excellent!""So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening. No, no. Front of the line.So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign. And I saw a sign. In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, ""Volunteers Needed."" Hmm. Well, they signed me up immediately. No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no. They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75. Yeah. They needed some young blood.So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss. I worked alone. Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop. While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, ""What do you do?"" Then I'd tell them, ""Well, I'm getting my hip replaced â in 18 months. It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"" All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop. So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification. I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office. And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them. Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line. And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that. Two reasons. First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip. But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all. Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.","As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design? What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore? If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience? If we could free ourselves from our education? What would these unseen forms look like? Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us? Would they delight us? If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?I propose we look to nature. Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms. And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes. We can abstract them and to create something that is new. Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells. And these cells can either be identical, or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces. We're free to choose where we make the fold. And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces. Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm. And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything. We can fold a million times faster, we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional, we start not with a single surface, but with a volume. A simple volume, the cube. If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks, for instance, like this. And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one. We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape, or this shape.So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. And we can play with this. We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. We can begin to sculpt the form.And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints. So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves, they can become impossibly small. We can make folds that we otherwise could not make. Surfaces can become porous. They can stretch. They can tear. And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.But in each case, I didn't design the form. I designed the process that generated the form. In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.But that's only half of the story â 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. A far more effective way to create forms, I have found, is to use information that is already contained in forms. A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges. White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones. We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are â all information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate, and that we can use to control the folding.So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one. There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation â it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again.So let's bring this process to architecture. How? And at what scale? I chose to design a column. Columns are architectural archetypes. They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology. A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. I started using four cylinders. Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this.And these columns, they have information at very many scales. We can begin to zoom into them. The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers. Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility. And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable? Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. In this case, the process is deterministic. There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable. There's too many surfaces, there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.So this leads to a new role for the architect. One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there. For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them. And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.But enough of the theory. At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue 3D glasses, got up very close to the screen, but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things. So there was only one possibility â to bring the column out of the computer.There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing. For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other. So instead, we decided to take the column, and we decided to build it as a layered model, made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top. Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery. From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce â and you're seeing a segment of it here â very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering, and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer. Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.But it was very labor intensive. There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical. It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces. The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium. And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.But it is increasingly possible. Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns, we used the bigger, faster machine, and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural, they can bear loads for once. Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. You can see a different column in the mirror, if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.So where does this leave us? I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects. I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature; there's countless other ones. In short, we have no constraints. Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up. And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.Thank you. (Applause)","Sixty-five million years ago, a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land. And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land â the little bits of land floating around â but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. And these animals disappeared, and a separate life, mammals, radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes, and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history can't really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth.So even before that impact was known, even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution, scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes: Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life. And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history. So we have a Mesozoic period, an age of fragmentation, and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection â South America to North America, India to Asia. And so my work, really, is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution.The work immediately begs the question, ""Why didn't they go into the waters?"" I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example. You can go outside â see many other examples. Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that? Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size, and why didn't they burrow? Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things, what kinds of animals were in those spaces? And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us about, you know, how evolution works on land? Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size. In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size â the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster.Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it, digging it up for many years, I end up looking at the mammal radiation, and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology, advancing by an order of magnitude. Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace, an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it. You want to measure it by diversity? You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size? Yes, they do have larger body size, but many of them are smaller, but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that. Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size. And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats.So there's lessons to learn, and there's lessons to learn from the exception, the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made, and many other scholars have made around the world. This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx. We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size â we're going to see where they began in a minute â and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. They became marine. We now know them today from the ice caps. There's burrowing birds. They inhabit the trees at all body sizes, and, of course, they inhabit the land.So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature. We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx, and if you go to different layers, you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between, so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs â or, more appropriately, feathers â as to decide whether it's actually a non-avian or an avian. It is the greatest transition that we have, actually, on land from one habitat to another, bar none, to understand how a bony, fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal could make such a transition. It is really our greatest â one of our greatest â evolutionary sequences.Now, my work began at the beginning. I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution, I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed. I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions: ""Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"" If we could roll that first video clip. This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds, and they're located in Northeastern Argentina. And we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff, dinosaurs had basically taken over. At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.You go into an area like this, you get a geologic map, you get a topographic map, and the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area. And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils. You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs and find, really, everything that existed â not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky, and you dig a place like that, you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did. 228 million years old, we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur: that's the Ur-dinosaur. A three-and-a-half foot thing, beautiful skull, predator, meat-eater, a two-legged animal. So, all the other dinosaurs that you know, or your kids know, at least, on four legs. This is sort of a look at the skull, and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long. It looks rather bird-like because it is. It's bird-like and hollow. A predator. Maybe 25 pounds, or 10 kilograms. That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began. That is 10 times larger than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation. We are extremely dinosaur-like, and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.Now, if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart, and dinosaurs found â landlubbers, as they are â found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces. Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents, because it was those continents that are least explored. If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally, you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth â Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia â and start putting together some of these pieces. I've been to some of those continents, but Africa was, in the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely. But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle, with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition.There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place. To be able to excavate the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out, you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions. Some of them are political. Many of them are physical. Some of them â the most important â are mental. And you really have to be able to withstand conditions â you have to drive into the desert, you will see landscapes in many cases â you can see from what we've discovered â that nobody else has ever seen. And the kinds of teams they bring in? Well, they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose. They're usually students who've never seen a desert. Some of them are more experienced.Your job as a leader â this is definitely a team sport â your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine. So, 125 degrees is normal. The ground surface at 150 â typical. So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes. So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu. You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people. These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries. Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground, and make them enter the pages of history. To do that, you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert.We're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger â or Niger, in our English language â north of Nigeria â that's where this photograph was taken. Basically you're talking about a country that, when we started working there, did not have container traffic. You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa, onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara. That's a 2,000 mile journey. So enormous excavations and a lot of work, and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there â 20 tons of material â we erect Jobaria, a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents. It really is a little bit out of place temporally. It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America. Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.And, you know, on and on â a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this â and some of you have had the chance to touch it â this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old. This is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered. It is an incredible view of life, and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time. It's only been with us for less than a century, and in that time, that fourth dimension, when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago, and we could actually tell how old some of these things were, is probably the most profound transformation, because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically. When you pick up a piece of history like that, I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science.That's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus. Here's some others. This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal. We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal. It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human. This was the cover of Science, because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals, but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway, smaller raptors. All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of â all those small animals â they all come from northern continents. This is the first skeleton from a southern continent, and guess what? You start preparing it. It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor. It's really a wholly separate radiation. So what we're trying to piece together here is a story. It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa.Crocodiles, of course, and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet. And huge things â I mean, this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile. The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus. That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. We had to try and reconstruct this. We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale. Could I have the second little video clip? Now, this field is just â and, of course, science in general â is just â adventure. We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today.Narrator: ... as long as their boat.Man: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.Narrator: If they can just land it, this croc will provide useful data, helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.Man: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.Man: I got the back legs.Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend. I've got it. I've got the back legs. Somebody get the front legs.Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there. Wow. Sixty-five. Wow. That's a big skull.Narrator: Big, but less than half the size of supercroc's skull.Man: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.Man: I knew it was big.PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide to release the animal back into the river.PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!Narrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.PS: Okay, when I say three, we move. One, two, three! Whoa!So â there were â (Applause) Well, you know, the â the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way. We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically. It depended on the shape of their skull, though, so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male. Anyway, you find other things, too. I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site. We found this last year. Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.This is a ceremonial disk. An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting. And then work later is going to take us to Tibet. Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland. It's really an island continent. It was a precursor to India, a messenger from Gondwana â a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. No one's found them. We know where they are, and we're going to go and get them next year. They're only between 13 and 14,000 feet, but if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K. Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution. I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further. We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means. We can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution, but we can learn some of the rules of the game, and that's really what we're trying to do.With regard to the biogeographic question, the Earth is dividing. These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices. You get divided, and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree, or you're crafty, and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division, or you're living peacefully on each side, and on one side you just go extinct, and you survive on the other side and create a difference. And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you. And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem. And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated â we call it dispersal â around the globe, with the slightest land bridge. They did it within two or three degrees of the pole, to maintain similarity between continents. But when they were divided, indeed they were divided, and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs.But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction. We have downgraded this factor. It carves up the history of life, and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end, right before the bolide impact. The best way to test this is to actually create a model. So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life. I want to give you three dimensions. So you see the tree of life, but now I've added the dimension of area. So the tree of life is normally divergence over time. Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.This is a computer program which has three knobs. We can control those things that we're worried about: extinction, sampling, dispersal â going from one area to another. And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like, and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters, to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not, at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago, which is related to the fact that I never â and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters, there's a number of you out there â I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand, but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific, technical, entertainment career as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools. I was one of those. I was failed by my school â my school failed me. Who's pointing fingers? Several teachers nearly killed me. I found myself in art. I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school. And I went on â that's my first painting on canvas. I read a dictionary. I got into college. I became an artist. O.K., and started drawing. It became abstract. I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York. Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there. Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio. I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.But really it's the same discipline â they're kindred disciplines. I mean, is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen, in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there, or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another? This is a very extraordinarily visual. I give you a human face because you're experts at that. It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs. They're really kindred disciplines. But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get, collect together, those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres. We all know, and there's been several allusions to it, that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists, engineers and technicians.We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase, and now, as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing, it becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from? And a more general question for our society is, what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind? What about all the kids like me that were in school â kids like some of you out there â that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology?Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important. Niger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately to do something in Niger. They have an AIDS problem. I asked â the U.S. State Department asked the government recently, What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems. Dinosaurs was one of them. Give us a museum of dinosaurs, and we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry. And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED, or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country. But when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities, the cities where most of you come from â certainly the city I come from â there's legions of kids out there like these. And the question is â and we started to address this question for centuries â as to how we get these kids involved in science.We've started in Chicago an organization â a non-profit organization â called Project Exploration. These are two kids from Project Exploration. We met them in their early stages in high school. They were â failing to poor students, and they are now â one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois. We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old. And we created a track record. Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies, track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none. So, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation, 90 percent going to college, many first-generation, 90 percent of those choosing science as a career. It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say, well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start, but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.It's gone through science as an inquiry, which was a big advance, and Dewey back at Chicago â you learn by doing. To â you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist, and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist. The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist. You have to have those steps. If you have â It's easy to get kids interested in science. It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist, which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person, and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.And so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago. We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing â and I've talked to some people here at TED â it's not going to look like anything you've seen before. It's going to be part-school, part-museum hall, part-conservatory, part-zoo, and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science. Thank you very much.","So, here we go: a flyby of play.It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play. At the bottom of this, it says, ""It's deeper than gender. Seriously, but dangerously fun. And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."" Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing? You see any adults?Well, lets go back to the 15th century. This is a courtyard in Europe, and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play. All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting. And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. I think we may have lost something in our culture.So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence. North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November, there's no ice on Hudson Bay. And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male, he's wild and fairly hungry. And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer, is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered. And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear, with a predatory gaze. Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you, there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble. But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail. And something very unusual happens. That fixed behavior â which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal â changes. And this polar bear stands over the husky, no claws extended, no fangs taking a look. And they begin an incredible ballet.A play ballet. This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death. And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear, and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state. They're in a state of play. And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible. They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals. And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.Now how did I get involved in this? John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have. The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes, in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder, to the importance of play, in that that individual, by deep study, was found to have severe play deprivation. Charles Whitman was his name. And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists, did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated. And that finding has stood the test of time â unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play, but I didn't really understand what it was. And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it. And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means. But there are ways of looking at it that I think can give you â give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play. When that mother and infant lock eyes, and the infant's old enough to have a social smile, what happens â spontaneously â is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother. And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby. If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram, the right brain of each of them becomes attuned, so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans. And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play, but it's never just singularly one thing.We're going to look at body play, which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity. This is a mountain goat. If you're having a bad day, try this: jump up and down, wiggle around â you're going to feel better. And you may feel like this character, who is also just doing it for its own sake. It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play. If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play. And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball, and he or she's going to roll down a hill. And â they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful. The human hand, in manipulation of objects, is the hand in search of a brain; the brain is in search of a hand; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.JPL we heard this morning â JPL is an incredible place. They have located two consultants, Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson, who are â Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic. He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach, and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems. And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own, that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars, hadn't worked with their hands. Frank Wilson had written a book called ""The Hand."" They got together â JPL hired them. Now JPL, NASA and Boeing, before they will hire a research and development problem solver â even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech â if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life, played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well. So play is practical, and it's very important.Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter) But it has to be safe exploration. This happens to be OK â he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene. If you want to belong, you need social play. And social play is part of what we're about here today, and is a byproduct of the play scene.Rough and tumble play. These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting. But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky: no claws, flat fur, soft eyes, open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements, curvilinear movements â all specific to play. And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us. Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle, scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts â cognitive, emotional and physical â that come as a part of rough and tumble play.Spectator play, ritual play â we're involved in some of that. Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment â rare â where the Red Sox won the World Series. But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.Imaginative play. I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture, but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination, her ability to spin yarns at this age â preschool. A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play.And I love this one, because it's also what we're about. We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story. The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story. I'm telling you a story today about play. Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long, but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.So what does play do for the brain? Well, a lot.We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain, because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play. I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record, and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play, it was obvious that they were not â did not feel that play was serious. I think that â that's a few years back â I think that wave is past, and the play wave is cresting, because there is some good science.Nothing lights up the brain like play. Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum, puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe â the executive portion â helps contextual memory be developed, and â and, and, and.So it's â for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way. And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about. And this is one of the ways you can study play â is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram. I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility, which has limited the actual study of play. And we've got a mother-infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does. The animal world has objectified it. In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play â they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play. If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with, and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with, and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar, they're hardwired to flee and hide. Pretty smart â they don't want to get killed by a cat. So what happens? They both hide out. The non-players never come out â they die. The players slowly explore the environment, and begin again to test things out. That says to me, at least in rats â and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture â that play may be pretty important for our survival.And, and, and â there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter) This took a long time â I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk. And we do know that in domestic animals and others, when they're play deprived, they don't â and rats also â they don't develop a brain that is normal.Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work, it's depression. And I think if you think about life without play â no humor, no flirtation, no movies, no games, no fantasy and, and, and. Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise without play. And the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.And we all have capacity to play signal. Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago. What's going to follow from that behavior is play. And you can trust it. The basis of human trust is established through play signals. And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults. That's a shame. I think we've got a lot of learning to do.Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps. So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural. You know, you can tell â and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals.You may not know this word, but it should be your biological first name and last name. Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood. And we are, by physical anthropologists, by many, many studies, the most neotenous, the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures. And therefore, the most playful. And this gives us a leg up on adaptability.Now, there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here, which is the play history. Your own personal play history is unique, and often is not something we think about particularly.This is a book written by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll. Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances: alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia, black, had to take care of a younger brother. Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined, he felt something different. And so he followed up on it. And his life â the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect â potentially prison or death â he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker. And he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life.Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress. Those of you who remember Al Gore, during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency, may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person, at least in public. And looking at his history, which is common in the press, it seems to me, at least â looking at it from a shrink's point of view â that a lot of his life was programmed. Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play â because I do know something about that â he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive, which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.So what I would encourage on an individual level to do, is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have, whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation. And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now. And you'll find, you may change jobs â which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this â in order to be more empowered through their play. Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it.Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because the d.school, the design school at Stanford, thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment, has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called ""From Play to Innovation."" And you'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking: ""to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis; to apply those principles, through design thinking, to promote innovation in the corporate world; and the students will work with real-world partners on design projects with widespread application.""This is our maiden voyage in this. We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun. There is our star pupil, this labrador, who taught a lot of us what a state of play is, and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there. And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall â and on the far right is, I think, a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize â Stuart Thompson, in neuroscience. So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO, and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom. And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring, and to try and do something about it. So what will follow is a student-made film about just that.Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. Characterized by a feeling of energized focus, full involvement and success in the process of the activity.An important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another, disruptive to the day. Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk. But it doesn't have to be that way.(Music)Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over. Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me. Because when you need it again, the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.The Wearable Meeting. Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting. But when you take it off â that's when the real action happens.(Music)(Laughter) (Applause)Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential â where you set aside time to play â but where your life becomes infused minute by minute, hour by hour, with body, object, social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play. And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life. Thank You.(Applause)John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go â I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play, that somehow, the way animals and humans deal with play, is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate, and I think probably because animals have taught us that. If you stop a cat from playing â which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff â they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong, or a race car driver, or a fireman, they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know. So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future â which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as â and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.And this is where my chasing animals for four, five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now, which is that play has a biological place, just like sleep and dreams do. And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically, animals sleep and dream, and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play. And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate. And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain. So it's not just something you do in your spare time.JH: How do you keep â and I know you're part of the scientific research community, and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else â how do you prevent â and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle. How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work, kind of like the Mozart metaphor, where, ""Oh, MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."" How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing?SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners â who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever â a state of play. So people know that it's there. And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson, and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists. And you get them into a group together focused on play, and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously. I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival â long term â as learning some of the basic things about public health.JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.(Applause)","(Music)I went down to St. James InfirmaryTo see my baby thereShe was lying on a long wooden tableSo cold, so still, so fairI went up to see the doctor""She's very low,"" he saidI went back to see my babyGood God she's lying there deadI went down to old Joe's bar roomOn the corner of the squareThey were serving drinks as per usualAnd the usual crowd was thereTo my left stood Old Joe McKennedyHis eyes were bloodshot redHe turned to the crowd around himAnd these are the words he said""Let her go, let her go, God bless herWherever she may beShe can search this whole wide world all overBut she'll never find another man like meShe can search this whole wide world all overAnd she'll never find another man like meWhen I die, please God, bury meIn my ten-dollar Stetson hatPut a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chainSo my friends know I died standing patGet six gamblers to carry my coffinAnd six choir girls to sing me a songStick a jazz band on my hearse wagonTo raise hell as I go alongNow that's the end of my storyLet's have another round of boozeAnd if anyone should ask youJust tell them I got the St. James Infirmary blues(Applause)","It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his ""I Have A Dream"" speech. But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression, but a lasting one that remains.I was born in a family full of colors. My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone. He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents. The matriarch, my grandma, has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair. My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, like my uncle and my cousin. My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian, with a pinch of hazel and honey, and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk, but with a lot of coffee. She has two sisters. One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other, also adopted, more on the beige side, like a pancake.(Laughter)Growing up in this family, color was never important for me. Outside home, however, things were different soon. Color had many other meanings.I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings. It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil. I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink. My skin was brown, and people said I was black. I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny. By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party, people thought I was the maid. I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends. And many times, visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings, I was invited not to use the main elevator. Because in the end, with this color and this hair, I cannot belong to some places.In some way, I get to used to it and accept part of it. However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.Years later I married a Spaniard. But not any Spaniard. I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.(Laughter)Since then, a new question started to chase me. What will be the color of your children? As you can understand, this is my last concern. But thinking about it, with my previous background, my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer. And that is how Humanae was born.Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors, rather than the untrue white, red, black or yellow associated with race. It's a kind of game to question our codes. It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.I portray the subjects in a white background. Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.I started with my family and friends, then more and more people joined the adventure, thanks to public calls coming through the social media.I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain.The snowball started to roll. The project had a great welcome â invitations, exhibitions, physical formats, galleries and museums ... just happened. And among them, my favorite: when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street, it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community.I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, 19 different cities around the world. Just to mention some of them â from someone included in the Forbes list, to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat. In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter. And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.All kinds of beliefs, gender identities or physical impairments, a newborn or terminally ill. We all together build Humanae.Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other. When modern science is questioning the race concept, what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red? Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair? Or does it have to do with our origin, nationality or bank account?This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery. Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people. It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me. I have hundreds of that, I will share with you, too.A mother of 11 years â A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, ""Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence, as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway. So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me.""A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote, ""All my life, people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group, a stereotype, a box. Perhaps we should stop. Instead of framing, ask the individual, 'How would you label yourself?' Then I would say, 'Hi. I'm Massiel. I'm a Dominican-Dutch, I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman.' ""Besides these unexpected and touching reactions, Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields. Just to show you some examples, illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies. It's a collection of faces.Researchers in the fields of anthropology, physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity, optophysiology, face recognition or Alzheimer's.One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, one of the most relevant political publications. And talking about foreign affairs, I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ... teachers. They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes. Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes, but this time as a teacher myself.My students, both adults and kids, paint their self-portraits, trying to discover their own unique color.As a photographer, I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate. As an individual, as AngÃ©lica, every time I take a picture, I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist. All the frustration, fear and loneliness that I once felt ... becomes love.The last country â the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born, Brazil. We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination. That remains a common practice worldwide, and that will not disappear by itself.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.","Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.Now, I want to tell you a story about that. It involves data from a NASA mission, ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.It began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission. Kepler's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system. It did this by staring at a single field in the sky, this one, with all the tiny boxes. And in this one field, it monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars continuously for four years, taking a data point every 30 minutes. It was looking for what astronomers call a transit. This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight, just so that the planet crosses in front of a star. And when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight, which you can see as a dip in this curve.And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the Kepler data.At the same time of the first data release, astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing: What if computers missed something?And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at the same data. The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition, sometimes even better than a computer. However, there was a lot of skepticism around this. My colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project, said that people at the time were saying, ""You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal."" And so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble. And if we found one planet, we would be thrilled. When I joined the team four years ago, we had already found a couple. And today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts, we have found dozens, and we've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy.So to understand this, let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like. On this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light, and on the bottom is time. The white line is light just from the star, what astronomers call a light curve. Now, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light, and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself. And so, for example, let's take Jupiter. Planets don't get much bigger than Jupiter. Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness. Earth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and the signal is barely visible in the data.So back to our mystery. A few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits, and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852. The observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted, and they started talking about this in the discussion forums.They said and object like Jupiter would make a drop like this in the star's light, but they were also saying it was giant. You see, transits normally only last for a few hours, and this one lasted for almost a week.They were also saying that it looks asymmetric, meaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter, it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side. This seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet. There are few more dips that happened, but for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.And then in March of 2011, we see this. The star's light drops by a whole 15 percent, and this is huge compared to a planet, which would only make a one percent drop. We described this feature as both smooth and clean. It also is asymmetric, having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week, and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.And again, after this, not much happens until February of 2013. Things start to get really crazy. There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear, and they last for like a hundred days, all the way up into the Kepler mission's end. These dips have variable shapes. Some are very sharp, and some are broad, and they also have variable durations. Some last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week. And there's also up and down trends within some of these dips, almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other. And at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent. This means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.This is truly remarkable. And so the citizen scientists, when they saw this, they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up. And so when the science team looked at it, we're like, ""Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data."" But we looked really, really, really hard, and the data were good. And so what was happening had to be astrophysical, meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight. And so at this point, we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on. And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery, they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand.First, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it. And then somebody else said, well, what if the star had already formed planets, and two of these planets had collided, similar to the Earth-Moon forming event. Well, both of these theories could explain part of the data, but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young, and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star's light, and you would expect this if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced. And so somebody else said, well, how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit? Well, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations. But I agree, it does feel a little contrived. You see, it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets. But of all the bad ideas we had, this one was the best. And so we went ahead and published our findings.Now, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote. Scientists are meant to publish results, and this situation was far from that. And so we decided to give it a catchy title, and we called it: ""Where's The Flux?"" I will let you work out the acronym.(Laughter)So this isn't the end of the story. Around the same time I was writing this paper, I met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright, and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data. And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision, it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars, but it didn't. And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found, and he said to me, ""Aw crap, Tabby. Now I have to rewrite my paper.""So yes, the natural explanations were weak, and we were curious now. So we had to find a way to rule out aliens. So together, we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue. We wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.A couple months later, news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles, over 10,000 articles, on this star alone. And if you search Google Images, this is what you'll find.Now, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well, how do aliens actually explain this light curve? OK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own. In this hypothetical circumstance, this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet, so where could they get more energy? Well, they have a host star just like we have a sun, and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star, then that would solve their energy needs. So they would go and build huge structures. These giant megastructures, like ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.This image above are lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres. It's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things, but you can think of it this way. The Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles. The simplest element on one of these structures is 100 times that size. They're enormous. And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star. You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.But it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics. You see, anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat, and we don't observe this. But it could be something as simple as they're just reradiating it away in another direction, just not at Earth.Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?(Laughter)You can see how this quickly captures your imagination.Well, there you have it. We're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand or an alien technology we don't understand. Personally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation. But don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens. Either way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.So what happens next? We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what's happening. But professional astronomers, like me, we have limited resources for this kind of thing, and Kepler is on to a different mission.And I'm happy to say that once again, citizen scientists have come in and saved the day. You see, this time, amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities, and I am so excited to see what they find.What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren't looking for something like this. And what's more exciting is that there's more data to come. There are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky.And just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this? And what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?Thank you.(Applause)"

The no-fuss wine inside shows tart citrus aromas with cheerful peach and pear endnotes.,"This wine is slightly spritzy and sugary, with simple yet clean apple flavors. The finish is sweet, quick and pleasantly quaffable. Best to chill it down before drinking.","Simple tones of citrus and cut grass open the bouquet of this fresh sparkling Prosecco. Talc powder and a very bright, almost steely quality of perlage characterizes the mouthfeel.","Made from 89% Petit Verdot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine opens with chalky, dusty tannin and a leathery mouthfeel. It opens slowly in the glass to reveal currant, blackberry and violet flavors. Powerful and elegant, it does the variety justice.","A serious personality comes from oaky, earthy aromas and flavors, a bit of welcome astringency and good acidity. It seems full bodied, dry and rich enough in texture to be appealing without losing the tanginess underneath.","Pure Syrah and 100% single vineyard, this young, tight wine is already beginning to reveal a fragrant side, suggesting black fruits, aromatic herbs and smoky pepper. Dark and spicy, the acids jut out a bit, showing a tart, lemony edge. This will need another year or two to develop and flesh out, but all the right components are here.","Sweet and simple. Tastes like a supermarket fruit juice blend of mango, peach and orange.","While it is still young, this is a complex wine, with black currant notes supported by firm tannins. It shows wood aging, fresh acidity and a solid core of structure that promises good aging. Drink from 2015.","Black cherries, dried herbs and a hint of toast make for a flavorful mouthful. Fleshy without being soft, thanks to vibrant acidity that will cut through rich meat dishes. No tannins to speak of, so there's no need to wait before popping the cork on this one.","A complex, full-bodied wine, structured with the DÃ£o's typical taut minerality. It has richness hidden behind the firm tannins and dense texture. This is still young and will develop over the next 3â4 years."

Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.","With black currant fruits dominant, this is an inherently fruity wine. The juicy feel makes the wine seem light, not yet quite connecting between fruit and a very dry tannic texture. Give it until 2016.","Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty.","Carneros shows its hand in the brisk acidity, surprisingly light body and herbal notes of this Pinot Noir. It feels delicate in structure and finishes dry, with a hint of raspberry cookie richness.","Relatively light in color, this lower-alcohol wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area shows dried rose petals, bergamot, lavender, cinnamon and a tiny bit of mushroomy funk on the nose. Once sipped, pomegranate, dark cranberry and orange-peel elements are lifted by pencil lead, rosemary and a strong thyme component.","Light-apricot in color, this wine offers a bouquet of Fuji apple and orange peel. It has flavors of clementine, orange, hazelnut, leather and smoke. Strong tannins are counterbalanced by bold acidity, and a finish marked by clementine and orange rind flavors leaves a pleasing tannic halo on the tongue and gums.","This delivers a very lively and plush quality of ripe blackberry, leather, tobacco, cola and cigar box. The mouthfeel is bold, soft and velvety. Keep this wine in your cellar for five years or more.","This pretty Cannonau-based wine opens with ripe aromas of blackberry, tobacco and dried spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, plush and dense.","Briny, powdery white-fruit aromas are offset by vanilla cookie notes and a hint of bath soap. This feels foamy and chunky, while lemon-lime and melon flavors finish bland but inoffensive.","From the biodynamic block at Wallula, this is truly a bone-dry style, with intense concentration. It's fruity and complex, with grapefruit and lemon rind flavors that are backed with astonishing minerality. The acidity is high but natural and perfectly integrated. The dry extract gives texture to an amazingly-long finish."

 on 19 Dec. 2015 // The car is much heavier than expected which gives it a nice weight and the wheels and paint finish are very well done. I love the size of it too.I bought this a present for someone else but as others reported that theirs arrived broken, so I opened it when it arrived and found one of the head lamps broken off and missing. It's not in the box so it must have been packed like that, which means I'm going to have to give someone a present that is not complete which sucks. And the stripes down the sides feel very flimsy and you can tell that they are going to break off quickly even with careful handling.Such a weird combination of quality and cheap finishes.As others have said, for the cost you would expect the doors to open at the very least. Or have the boys weapons on the seat, something that made it obvious that it was from the show and not just a regular Impala. With just a tiny bit more effort, this could have been a fantastic product. If they remade this product with those features I would buy one for myself in a heartbeat. | looks Great,  lacking in detail though ! // 4.0 // 20 Nov. 2014 // By

In this intimate musical, Alison sets out to unravel the many mysteries of her childhood through a series of memories and conversations - from her coming out to her moving journey to acceptance. Gary Griffin (Hand to God, Never the Sinner) directs this emotionally charged family drama that The New York Times calls extraordinary, and a rare beauty. Let's meet in the lobby 20 minutes before the performance.",Ask at reception for the meetup or text Raphi Salem[masked] We usually get a ping pong or pool table,This regular Meet up has been cancelled for the summer and will resume in September.,"The Handmaids Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishments calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaids Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.",Please make sure to RSVP herehttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/nyc-creative-and-business-professionals-networking-party-tickets-27142697539 New York City is a big city with so many great people to network with.

The 2008 United Nations System of National Accounts (2008 SNA) offers three plausible indicators for calculating growth: the volume of gross domestic product (GDP), real gross domestic income, and real gross national income. The volume of GDP is the sum of value added, measured at constant prices, by households, government, and industries operating in the economy. GDP accounts for all domestic production, regardless of whether the income accrues to domestic or foreign institutions.",,,"Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.","A general and continuing increase in an economyâs price level is called inflation. The increase in the average prices of goods and services in the economy should be distinguished from a change in the relative prices of individual goods and services. Generally accompanying an overall increase in the price level is a change in the structure of relative prices, but it is only the average increase, not the relative price changes, that constitutes inflation. A commonly used measure of inflation is the consumer price index, which measures the prices of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by a typical household. The consumer price index is usually calculated on the basis of periodic surveys of consumer prices. Other price indices are derived implicitly from indexes of current and constant price series.",,,,The Gender Parity Index (GPI) indicates parity between girls and boys. A GPI of less than 1 suggests girls are more disadvantaged than boys in learning opportunities and a GPI of greater than 1 suggests the other way around. Eliminating gender disparities in education would help increase the status and capabilities of women.,

A ""complete"" vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data.

Estimates of neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality tend to vary by source and method for a given time and place. Years for available estimates also vary by country, making comparisons across countries and over time difficult. To make neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality estimates comparable and to ensure consistency across estimates by different agencies, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which comprises the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Division, and other universities and research institutes, developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information to reconcile differences. The method uses statistical models to obtain a best estimate trend line by fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates.","Consumer price indexes are constructed explicitly, using surveys of the cost of a defined basket of consumer goods and services.",,"The IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014, harmonized with the 2008 SNA, recommends an accrual accounting method, focusing on all economic events affecting assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, not just those represented by cash transactions.

As burocracias para confirmar a identidade do cliente, como fotocÃ³pias de documentos e verificaÃ§Ãµes de assinatura, poderÃ£o ser resolvidas pela internet, de acordo com autorizaÃ§Ã£o dada pelo Banco Central nesta segunda-feira (25). AtÃ© entÃ£o, os futuros clientes conseguiam iniciar o processo de abertura pela internet, normalmente preenchendo um formulÃ¡rio com dados pessoais e informaÃ§Ãµes de renda, mas era necessÃ¡rio ir pessoalmente a uma agÃªncia ou assinar documentos em papel para concluir a operaÃ§Ã£o. A decisÃ£o do Conselho MonetÃ¡rio Nacional (CMN) autoriza os bancos a cuidarem de todo o processo por meios eletrÃ´nicos. Segundo o , o Banco Central acredita que a abertura remota de contas poderÃ¡, inclusive, dificultar as fraudes, jÃ¡ que os meios eletrÃ´nicos oferecem mecanismos adicionais de verificaÃ§Ã£o: pense, por exemplo, na utilizaÃ§Ã£o do GPS do smartphone para analisar a localizaÃ§Ã£o do cliente e tecnologias de reconhecimento facial e de voz como instrumentos de confirmaÃ§Ã£o de identidade. A medida nÃ£o Ã© obrigatÃ³ria, ou seja, cada banco pode ou nÃ£o permitir a abertura e fechamento de conta corrente pela internet, desde que possua mecanismos de verificaÃ§Ã£o adequados para confirmar a identidade do cliente e prevenir fraudes. Na prÃ¡tica, a decisÃ£o regulamenta e abre espaÃ§o para instituiÃ§Ãµes como o Banco Intermedium e o Banco Original, que estÃ£o dispensando agÃªncias fÃ­sicas e investindo em aplicativos para movimentaÃ§Ã£o de conta e atendimento ao cliente. Em marÃ§o, o Banco Central decidiu que documentos digitalizados, para fins de operaÃ§Ãµes no sistema bancÃ¡rio, tÃªm o mesmo valor legal do documento de origem. No caso de contas abertas pela internet, os bancos devem obrigatoriamente assegurar a possibilidade de encerrar o relacionamento por meio eletrÃ´nico. AlÃ©m disso, as mesmas disposiÃ§Ãµes para contas abertas de maneira presencial se aplicarÃ£o Ã s contas digitais, incluindo as atualizaÃ§Ãµes de situaÃ§Ã£o cadastral, regulamentaÃ§Ãµes de tarifas estabelecidas pelo Banco Central e prevenÃ§Ã£o de lavagem de dinheiro.","A TP-Link Ã© famosa por suas soluÃ§Ãµes de rede, que incluem desde adaptadores comuns atÃ© roteadores de alta potÃªncia - e nÃ³s atÃ© jÃ¡ testamos alguns roteadores da marca que nos impressionaram bastante.

Even when using an agile approach, there's still a need to forecast over a long time period. The challenge is to combine both a long-term vision and frequent, continuous delivery along the way. We tend to find that a lot of teams using JIRA are actually tracking and strategic goals in disconnected tools like spreadsheets, which can be quite painful and time consuming! So today I'm going to show you how our resident experts on planning, the JIRA Portfolio team, use JIRA Portfolio to combine long-term planning and agile development. Let's see how the team does it - are you ready to jump into some planning? Start with the big picture Every quarter, the JIRA Portfolio team does a full roadmap review and planning, along with reviewing and updating objectives and key results. To start off, the team first defines the strategic themes for the roadmap by answering general questions like, "" where are we going? "" and "" where should we be spending our time "" (note that they don't focus on questions like "" what specific features do we want to build "" ). Techniques for coming up with this high-level product strategy could fill a separate blog post, but it roughly involves reviewing customer suggestions on jira.atlassian.com , customer interview notes, and feedback from teams within Atlassian to identify structural gaps (the combination of these two are used to identify recurring/common/structural problems), as well as reviewing advancements in the market and the strategic goals of the the wider organization. The two dominant themes that came out of the latest planning session for the JIRA Portfolio roadmap ""Integrated planning"" (think a tighter integration with JIRA and JIRA Agile) and ""PPM at scale"" (think views and reports across multiple plans). There were lots of other themes, of course, but these two are the priorities and where the team decided they would devote most of their time. ProTip : Prepare to iterate! Distilling a roadmap to 3-5 crisp focus areas is hard! The team typically knows the outcome is good if the themes feel like ""stating the obvious,"" and the general response from peers is ""well, of course that's what you need to focus on... what else would make sense?"" Identify the big-ticket items Once the themes were decided on as a team (and, of course, backed by clearly-defined goals and success metrics), the Product Manager entered them into JIRA Portfolio. The team then got together again to think about what actually needed to be done in order to accomplish these themes, answering questions like ""what big chunks of work do we need to get done in order to deliver on this theme?"" or""what needs to happen in order to ensure that gets delivered?"" For example, when they sat down to see what they needed to accomplish for the theme ""Integrated planning,"" it resulted in things like ""simplified data management"" and ""live planning and snapshots."" . Note that while several initiatives are specific to the JIRA Portfolio team, there are also initiatives shared with and mostly driven by other teams inside Atlassian. For example, a new feature in the JIRA platform might require the JIRA Portfolio team to integrate with this new functionality. Get all the data in one place the time consuming but well worth the work. Those ""big chunks of work"" mentioned earlier, i.e. initiatives, now needed to be broken down into more consumable pieces, so it was time to . This was done as a combination of: Breaking down initiatives into new epics and stories : Brainstorming between product management, engineering, and UX designers, to slice out tangible and incrementally shippable pieces of work. This was done inside JIRA Portfolio, and once the epics and stories were ready for implementation, they were turned into actual JIRA issues. Importing existing issues : The Product Manager also imported all of the relevant epics and stories that already existed in JIRA such as customer suggestions gathered on jira.atlassian.com and assigned them to the right initiatives. ProTip : When importing a big amount of existing, un-estimated issues, it isn't necessary to estimate all of them individually. JIRA Portfolio allows you to enter a default estimate for both epics and stories. Taking an average value of past stories is usually sufficient for a rough plan, as long as the plan is then constantly updated and refined along the way. Gathering and grooming the backlog is definitely the most time consuming part - getting data from potentially multiple different JIRA projects and then assigning epics to the initiatives they set earlier. Once this is done, however, the result is an awesome global overview, with aggregated progress and status across initiatives and it is super easy to dive into planning. JIRA Portfolio Cloud recently launched (yay! ï¿½ï¿½ ) so the below shows you how the team tracked progress and status for this initiative. Time to start planning The JIRA Portfolio team uses story points for estimation, so the Product Manager just grabbed the team's velocity straight from the Agile Board. The team is actually growing so they have split work into two streams: JP Core (continuous improvement on version 1.x) and JP2 (fundamental changes towards 2.x). See the roadmap for the first time So, JIRA Portfolio took all of the team's planning and calculated a realistic schedule for the (yes, the dates in the schedule are blank to spur imagination). The schedule below is set to the initiatives view to see the projected start and end dates of each initiative. Play with ""what-if"" scenarios Now with roadmap done (or at least ""visible at last""), the team was in full planning mode! With all the data in place, the Product Manager and Development Manager in collaboration with program management, began to move around variables like earlier release dates, scope changes, feature date adjustments, and people planning. Trying different planning scenarios was especially important as the team was determining whether to add the functionality of cost planning and reporting into the scope of their 2.x release. Because the team had all of the data in , they were able to model these what-if scenarios and instantly see the impact a possible change might have on the future. This is also a great way to communicate openly with stakeholders and clearly point out the tradeoffs. See how reality lines up with goals It was now time to head back and look at those themes we spoke about earlier. So much planning and scoping had happened since then and the team was interested to see if the detailed plan matched the high-level targets for investment allocation. Thankfully, the plan looked quite balanced! ""Integrated planning"" was slightly underfunded relative to the target, as the plan contained more work on UX improvements and convenience functions. However, it was easy for the Product Manager and Development Manager to jump back into the the schedule and backlog to see what was driving this and how they could adjust. Put the plan to action As mentioned earlier, the team creates a lot of epics and stories directly in . Once the plan is done, they then create these epics and stories in bulk so that the team can actually work on the issue in JIRA and JIRA Agile. The team tries to keep the backlog on the agile board short and easily manageable, and typically only creates issues from the plan prior to the planning meeting for the next sprint. For any upcoming sprint, the relevant issues can be directly created from the schedule view. Ensure the plan is up to date The JIRA Portfolio team does these planning sessions quarterly, however, the plan is still updated after each sprint There are two key activities the Product Manager does after each sprint to keep the plan up-to-date: A to re-baseline with what has actually been done (which issues have been resolved, how much is remaining if still open). If new stories have been added somewhere in JIRA (either a scope change, or an epic has been broken down into detailed stories), the Product Manager imports these into JIRA Portfolio to check the impact on the plan. Share, discuss, communicate So what did the team do with this living, breathing plan? They shared it! plan at Atlassian so everyone is kept up to date and on the same page with what the plans are. that they have set up in the JIRA Portfolio space. It's great to share information with the whole team and to interactively play through planning scenarios! And thats a wrap! We know that's a lot to take in, so if you want more info, some live demos and the chance for Q&A, join Martin Suntinger, Principal Product Manager for JIRA Portfolio, in the next JIRA Portfolio webinar. to know how you're using JIRA Portfolio so tell us in the comments below!

Em financiamento no Kickstarter , o OLO simplesmente permite que vocÃª transforme o seu smartphone em uma impressora 3D. Exato, nÃ£o hÃ¡ qualquer pegadinha aqui: vocÃª vai imprimir formas fÃ­sicas por meio do seu celular. A impressÃ£o acontece da seguinte maneira: com um aparato apropriado (OLO), a luz que emana da tela de um smartphone acaba formando criaÃ§Ãµes plÃ¡sticas. Esse aparato possui um reservatÃ³rio de 400 cm cÃºbicos, 100 gramas de resina fotopolÃ­mera e uma tampa mecanizada para separar as Ã¡reas. Com um aplicativo para Android, iOS e Windows Phone , o OLO se encaixa no celular como um Cardboard, por exemplo. Ele utiliza as mesmas funÃ§Ãµes de uma impressora de projeÃ§Ã£o digital de luz (DLP) - normalmente, os projetores de luz sÃ£o grandes e caros nessas soluÃ§Ãµes; aqui, o emissor Ã© a tela do smartphone. Batizado de ""resina de luz do dia"", o lÃ­quido presente no OLO se solidifica por meio da luz branca. Assim, ""vocÃª pode criar objetos duros, flexÃ­veis, fundÃ­veis ou elÃ¡sticos"", diz a pÃ¡gina da OLO no Kickstarter. Ainda faltam 19 dias para o financiamento do OLO terminar . Contudo, a meta de US$ 80 mil (R$ 287 mil) jÃ¡ foi batida, e a equipe responsÃ¡vel jÃ¡ alcanÃ§ou US$ 1,6 milhÃ£o (R$ 5,7 milhÃµes). Para comprar o OLO, basta pagar cerca de R$ 355. Vale a pena ter uma impressora 3D em casa? Comente no FÃ³rum do TecMundo","BigQuery is Google Cloud Platform 's serverless analytics data warehouse. It's used by thousands of companies - both big and small - to store, understand, and analyze large amounts of data. Today, we're announcing a host of new features that make BigQuery more compatible with traditional big data workflows: Standard SQL Beta If you're familiar with the SQL standard or have used another standard-compliant SQL engine, you'll feel right at home with the Beta of BigQuery's revamped SQL dialect . Notable features that we've added with this new dialect include: More advanced query planning and optimization: BigQuery now provides very robust decorrelation, which allows you to write complex subqueries in any clause of your SQL statement (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) A richer type system with fully composable types: In addition to the existing data types BigQuery users are used to, we've added dates, times, arrays and structs, as well as additional support for timestamps Extended JOIN support: BigQuery now supports Theta JOIN , which offers the ability to use inequalities in your join key comparisons, as well as arbitrary expressions as JOIN conditions. While we think the updated dialect is a wonderful addition, there's no requirement that users switch, and for production use cases, we recommend users remain on the legacy SQL dialect. After we have a few more miles on the new dialect, we plan to launch it to general availability and recommend it as the default language for all projects. Identity & Access Management (IAM) Beta Now that BigQuery supports Standard SQL, you'll have more and more teams in your company requesting access to BigQuery projects. Earlier this year we announced Cloud IAM for Cloud Platform. We're now making IAM available for BigQuery as well, in Beta. This feature is currently being rolled out, so if you don't see it today you can expect it enabled on your projects this month - BigQuery roles will be made available in Google Cloud's ""IAM & Admin"" control panel. Cloud IAM fully automates managing permissions for BigQuery projects. Administrators can define fine-grained security policies they want for their users and resources. For example, let's say your marketing team needs to query data, but doesn't need to modify or upload data to get their job done. With Cloud IAM and Google accounts, this process is a breeze. Administrators can create several roles, such as viewer, editor, user or owner. Time based table partitioning Time based partitioning makes it easy and cost-effective for you to manage your data and write queries that span multiple days, months or years. You can now create tables with time-based partitions - you load the data, and BigQuery will automatically put it in the right partition. Querying partitioned tables is easy - you simply provide a date or range of dates you want, and BigQuery will limit data processed to the time interval specified. Imagine that you had a marketing campaign that spanned the length of 3 months. Here's an example of a query to analyze logs from the past 3 months. You no longer have to manually partition your tables beforehand - it just works! BigQuery only scans the data in the specified partitions, rather than the whole table. Not only is this query more performant, it also costs you a fraction of the cost of querying the full table! BigQuery and Kabam Businesses come to Cloud Platform for our unique data analytics platform, and today we'll show you one such example. Kabam i s an international entertainment company that produces free-to-play video games for mobile devices. Kabam's games include Marvel: Contest of Champions, Fast & Furious: Legacy, and Star Wars: Uprising. Their average gamer enjoys more than two hours of gameplay a day! Data analytics is critical to Kabam's ability to keep gamers engaged in a highly competitive marketplace. Marvel: Contest of Champions became wildly successful after its release in December of 2014. With big popularity comes big data - in-game events and logs were generating well over 1 TB of data per day, and their previous data warehouse was not able to handle this sudden scale. As a result, Kabam had no way to gather insights about the game for several weeks. Costas Piliotis, lead analyst on the game, had used BigQuery at a previous company and suggested the team to give it a try. In six days they were able to ingest hundreds of terabytes of past game telemetry data. More importantly, they could now query data over the lifetime of the entire game. Thanks to BigQuery, Kabam is able to store and understand every single player action within their games, from game monetization to fraud, from production bugs to level-completion statistics. Now that the data lives in BigQuery, Costas and his team are most excited about applying Cloud Platform's Machine Learning tools to the data to make their games even more entertaining. Here in the BigQuery team, we often hear stories like this one and immediately the question that follows from people who've never tried BigQuery is, ""How does this compare to my current data warehouse?"" Two weeks ago we shared a summary of a great series of experiments on cloud data warehouse solutions performed by Mark Litwintschik where BigQuery really stood out. We've made this short video to explain why BigQuery is unique, which we hope will inspire you to give it a try.","Easy to use comparing IoT Platforms table . Building IoT project is a process that could involve the step of finding free platforms. As you may know, Internet of things is a set of physical objects that use network support to exchange data. These objects can be sensors, software, boards and so on. This is an interesting ecosystem where the software can be connected directly to real hardware or devices. The most known board for building internet of things project are Arduino (with its several versions) and Raspberry. Integrating these devices with cloud platforms is possible to collect and analyze data, create ""smart"" object that can be controlled remotely . One way to control such devices is using smartphones like Android and iOS devices. Dev Boards like Arduino or Raspberry are cheap and everyone can experiment IoT projects. Cloud IoT platforms help developers and maker to build IoT project and test them fast and easily . It is useful to compare IoT Platforms so that it is possible to select the right one according to our needs. Comparing IoT Platforms: analysis for building projects Cloud IoT platforms provides several kind of services that can be very useful in building IoT project : cloud data store data Event logic Platforms integration Cloud data store enables developers to store data sent from several boards (like Arduino or Raspberry); for example, it is possible to store values read from a sensor. This information can be visualized using a graph or analyzed with other tools. Event logic is web based programming logic that can be used to trigger some action when an event occurs. Using this kind of platforms is possible to implement some ""business logic"" using just a web interface without knowing much about the board we are using for the project. Usually ,the logic is like IF-THEN, for example if an event occurs then do this action. An event can be a signal read from a sensor and the action can be an email or an SMS. Platforms integration is a set of ""adapters"" that implements specific protocol so that it is possible without writing a line of code mix different internet services to make a chain of actions. For example, using Arduino with Ethernet shield is possible to send an alert via SMS when a value read from a sensor is higher than a threshold level. Build IoT project with free platform: Description Below, you find a list comparing IoT platforms that can be useful to create IoT projects with a brief description. Comparing IoT platforms isn't easy because they have different features and they are focused on different IoT aspects. This list comparing IoT platforms is built using six different IoT aspects: Data store (the capability to save and store data) Service Integration (the capability to integrate with other external systems) Data visualization (the capability to create charts using the data stored) SDK API (the availability of an SDK to simplify the development process) Event/rule Management (a built-in set of rules to manage the flow of the data) Free account Temboo : This is a very interesting platform that provides services to integrate Arduino, Raspberry and other platforms with different internet services (like SMS, Email and so on). This platform uses choreos that are connectors toward external services, so that events in Arduino, like sensor signals, can be transformed into different kind of events. Moreover, it provides some logic like IF-THEN. Carriots : This is another interesting platform that enables smart devices to store data. It uses the data stream concept to enable devices to send data. This platform moreover has a rule management system so that you can implement custom logic directly on the web. It can moreover send Email, SMS and Twitter messages NearBus : This proposes a different approach respect to other platforms. Usually, the basic concept that stands behind IoT platforms is connecting the device (Arduino, Raspberry and so on) to the cloud so that these boards can send data. NearBus provides a different way: it maps the device into the cloud so that it gets a part of the cloud itself. It uses an Agent to accomplish this task and it is possible to control this agent directly from the web using a set of API. Ubidots : This platforms support several kind of board and can be used to store data in the cloud. It offers data capture, data visualization with a built-in dashboard, rules management (or event management). With the built-in dashboard, it is possible to see in real time the graph built on the data sent by the device. It supports several kind of visualization. *Nearbus offers a different approach so it is quite difficult to categorize it **It offers a set of API easy to use The table above summarizes some aspects of these platforms, that i think they are important. The aim of this comparison is to provides some high-level information about existing IoT platforms and i invite the readers to read carefully each platform features directly on the respective website, before using it. The are other platforms that can be mentioned here like Xively or Sensorcloud that provide interesting services even if I still haven't time to use them. As you can notice, there are several type of platforms with different services, every platform has its unique aspects and it is up to developers and makers to choose the right one according to the project needs. This list comparing IoT platforms wants to help other developers when starting with an IoT project. Help me to increase the list to provide a better information.","Postos Shell adotam pagamento no smartphone Em cerca de 150 postos Shell no Rio de Janeiro e outros 40 em GoiÃ¢nia, quem faz a cobranÃ§a pelo combustÃ­vel agora sÃ£o as prÃ³prias bombas de gasolina. E o cliente paga pelo smartphone, desde que tenha o app Shell Box instalado e uma conta do PayPal. NÃ£o Ã© preciso digitar senha: o sistema de autenticaÃ§Ã£o ""one touch"", do PayPal, reconhece o usuÃ¡rio pela forma como segura seu smartphone. ""Ã uma experiÃªncia mais Ã¡gil. Em alguns postos, a pessoa precisa sair do carro para pagar na loja. Agora nÃ£o Ã© necessÃ¡rio nem mesmo abaixar o vidro. Em vez de a maquininha de cartÃ£o estar do lado de fora, ela estÃ¡ dentro do seu celular"", compara MÃ¡rio Mello, diretor geral da PayPal para a AmÃ©rica Latina. O passo a passo Ã© simples. Primeiro, o usuÃ¡rio instala em seu smartphone o aplicativo Shell Box ( Android , iOS ). Se jÃ¡ tiver uma conta PayPal registrada no aparelho, ela Ã© associada automaticamente. SenÃ£o, Ã© possÃ­vel abrir uma conta do serviÃ§o de pagamento atravÃ©s do app da Shell. Feito isso, quando estiver em um posto, o cliente deve abrir o aplicativo Shell Box, clicar no botÃ£o de abastecimento e informar o nÃºmero de identificaÃ§Ã£o da bomba, apresentado em um monitor ao lado da mesma. A digitaÃ§Ã£o desse cÃ³digo, que tem seis dÃ­gitos, deve ser feita durante o processo de abastecimento. Quando a mangueira Ã© posta de volta na bomba, esta se comunica com um servidor para o qual Ã© enviado o valor a ser cobrado. O servidor, por sua vez, verifica se algum usuÃ¡rio do app enviou recentemente o cÃ³digo de identificaÃ§Ã£o daquela bomba. Ã checada tambÃ©m a localizaÃ§Ã£o do smartphone, para ter certeza de que a pessoa estÃ¡ no posto. Se tudo estiver correto, a cobranÃ§a Ã© concluÃ­da no cartÃ£o de crÃ©dito que a pessoa tiver cadastrado no PayPal. A confirmaÃ§Ã£o do pagamento aparece no monitor ao lado da bomba para o frentista. E hÃ¡ tambÃ©m a impressÃ£o da nota na impressora fiscal do posto. Vale destacar que Ã© preciso que o smartphone tenha conexÃ£o Ã  Internet, para enviar seus dados, caso contrÃ¡rio nÃ£o Ã© possÃ­vel concluir a transaÃ§Ã£o. A Ipiranga tambÃ©m lanÃ§ou este ano uma soluÃ§Ã£o de pagamento atravÃ©s de app, o Abastece AÃ­, mas, no seu caso, em vez do PayPal, Ã© necessÃ¡rio ter uma tag do ConectCar, no qual Ã© feita a cobranÃ§a. A Shell avaliou a possibilidade de usar o Sem Parar, sistema de tags com o qual atualmente tambÃ©m se pode pagar pelo seu combustÃ­vel, e acabou preferindo a parceria com o PayPal. ""Achamos mais simples porque nÃ£o precisa de um device novo. E dÃ¡ para abastecer qualquer carro com o Shell Box, nÃ£o apenas aquele que tiver uma tag"", explica Eduardo Wantuil, diretor de marketing da RaÃ­zen, empresa que licencia a marca Shell no Brasil. A soluÃ§Ã£o serÃ¡ estendida para vÃ¡rios outros postos no interior de SÃ£o Paulo nas prÃ³ximas semanas, totalizando cerca de 400 atÃ© o final do ano. E ao longo de 2017 serÃ¡ expandida para todo o PaÃ­s. A Shell tem hoje mais de 5,9 mil postos no Brasil. Fidelidade O Shell Box funciona tambÃ©m como um canal de relacionamento da marca com seus consumidores. AtravÃ©s dele, a empresa vai oferecer promoÃ§Ãµes. A primeira jÃ¡ estÃ¡ no ar: nas compras a partir de R$ 50 em gasolina aditivada ou quatro litros de lubrificantes Shell Helix ou pelo menos R$ 25 nas lojas Shell Select, o cliente concorre a 10 mil milhas do programa Smiles. Quem fizer pagamento com PayPal pelo app participa automaticamente. Outros clientes podem concorrer tirando uma foto do cupom fiscal e enviando pelo app. LanÃ§ado no comeÃ§o do ano para o projeto piloto, o Shell Box agora ganhou uma campanha de marketing com abrangÃªncia nacional e acumula mais de 100 mil downloads.","Qloo Inc. closed a $4.5 million Series A round of venture funding to support the growth of its cultural recommendation engine. Investors included: Academy Award-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio; Starwood Hotels founder Barry Sternlicht; Pierre Lagrange of GLG Partners; and Adriaan Ligtenberg's AllMobile Fund, along with other individual angel investors. According to the startup's co-founder and CEO Alex Elias, New York City-based Qloo combs through proprietary and open source data online to learn about consumers' preferences, and how their tastes correlate across eight major categories: music, film, television, dining, nightlife, fashion, books and travel. The cultural correlations can sometimes surprise marketers. Here's an example Qloo shared with TechCrunch. Tomorrow, the Cleveland Cavaliers will face off against the Golden State Warriors in game 6 of the NBA Finals in Ohio. Sponsors and advertisers spend a lot to get their products in front of the basketball championship audience. So they don't want to alienate one team's fan base while appealing to the other. So what do Cavs and Warriors fans have in common? A love of Pizza, Sports Center and Empire on TV, and fashion brands Nike and Adidas. Otherwise, their tastes differ on everything from their favorite recording artists to their favorite films. In music today, Cavs fans are into Lil Wayne, Usher and Wiz Khalifa, Qloo reports. Warriors fandom is more strongly correlated with a love of Mac Dre, Tyga and Drake. In film, Cavaliers fans love Will Smith and Megan Fox, while Warriors fans prefer Kevin Hart and Jennifer Hudson. Besides helping marketers find the common ground between disparate groups they want to reach, Qloo offers developers an API that can power ""if you like this, try that"" features within different apps or websites they've built. Elias said that hotels have used Qloo to provide digital concierge services, e-commerce businesses have used Qloo to get customers to look at new products, and media and entertainment companies have used Qloo to guide choices on location, casting and soundtracks. Generally, the company makes revenue as a provider of business intelligence to marketers who are trying to determine what their existing customers do and do not like, and how to connect with new prospects. But Qloo also operates a standlone app of its own, which helps users find new content they may enjoy or restaurants to try. But Elias says the app is mostly a way to show off what a cultural recommendation engine can do. The new Series A funding brings the company's total capital raised to $7.5 million in total. Qloo's earlier seed investors included, among others, Cedric Kyle (a.k.a Cedric the Entertainer) and Tommy Thompson founding partner of Cross Creek Pictures. Qloo investor Adriaan Ligtenberg said he invested in Qloo because, ""They were one of the early companies that realized the value of collecting and analyzing big data for culture and entertainment. AI companies allow big data driven business decisions, the insights gained are valuable, for either opening new or optimizing revenue streams."" He expects Qloo to use its funding to increase the size and depth of their database, and win over new corporate clients. Qloo's CEO said the company is interested in expanding within hotels and resorts, restaurants, media and entertainment, and even seeks to become a part of connected cars, especially helping automakers deliver personalized recommendations in a navigation or entertainment system.","Mark your calendars, folks, it's official. Apple has issued press invites to its next media event on September 7. The company is widely expected to unveil new iPhones and could unveil new MacBook Pros and the Apple Watch 2 at the same event. The new iPhones are generally expected to feature a very similar design to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which suggests Apple could save the 'iPhone 7' name for 2017 models and use a version of the iPhone 6 name (like iPhone 6 SE ) this year. While it's unclear what Apple will name the new iPhones, we'll go with the consensus of iPhone 7 until we learn otherwise. While both models are expected to gain faster A10 processors and drop the 16GB tier for 32GB entry models, the most dramatic change is likely coming to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and not the 4.7-inch iPhone 7: a dual camera system. This could be used to emulate optical zoom where digital zoom basically crops a shot and loses detail. Both iPhone 7 models are expected to introduce a darker color for the black-front model. The iPhone 5 introduced a dark blue color called slate that was prone to scuffing, and Apple has played with versions of its 'space gray' gunmetal gray color since the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 7 is expected to feature a return to a dark blue color or maybe even a near black ' space black ' option. As you may notice in the alleged leaked cases above, Apple is also widely expected to drop the 3.5-mm headphone jack on both iPhone 7 models in a push toward Lightning, Bluetooth, and AirPlay audio. As for the Apple Watch 2, the anticipated refresh will mark the first update since the current model was unveiled two years ago and released a year and a half ago. The design is expected to look generally the same, but much needed speed improvements are on the way and a GPS chip for mapping workouts and using location services is expected. And 9to5Mac readers will be the first to express the need for updated MacBook Pros. The current lineup of Retina MacBook Pros features a design that hasn't been refreshed in years and internals that sorely need updated. The good news is that rumors have been very promising for MacBook Pros this year (as you can see with the render below). A slimmer design, Touch ID, and a dynamic OLED touch panel in place of static function hardware keys are all in the cards for the next MacBook Pro update. While new MacBook Pros are expected sometime this year, recent reports have claimed Apple could hold off on unveiling these new models at this September event. In recent years, Apple has held an iPhone-focused event in September, then an iPad-focused event in October, and Macs have appeared when ready. Last year, however, Apple packed all of its new products into a single fall event held in September including new iPhones, new Apple Watch colors and bands, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the fourth generation Apple TV. Apple later released the 9.7-inch iPad Pro at its March event earlier this year, new iPads aren't expected until next year , and rumors of an updated Apple TV haven't surfaced aside from one story late last year. Apple will also likely give stage time once again to its upcoming software updates: iOS 10 , macOS Sierra , watchOS 3 , and tvOS 10 . We'll bring you full coverage of Apple's September event next month as well as the latest on what we expect ahead of the event so stay tuned. In the meantime, here's plenty of reading material to get you up to speed before then:","O Google segue em sua campanha para conduzir empresas rumo a plataformas em nuvem pÃºblica.

The grilled one is not moist that makes the lobster meat a little bit dry. And for the burger, I would rather have a burger somewhere else. The butter garlic sauce is unbeatable I asked for a second one every time. Just to avoid lunch and dinner time as it doesn't worth to queue that long for this. Tips: The one in Harvey Nichols has the shortest queue and most of the time none.",Went here one night with no reservatio n but we were welcomed and the food was amazing. Has an open kitchen and a good wine list. Friendly and generous waiters.,"We visited on a busy Saturday and should have booked as the restaurant was packed. We were prepared to wait and the staff did their very best to find us a table, and fortunately after a while we were shown downstairs to a comfortable banquette, and again met Irvine a friendly and efficient waiter from Mexico who for his sins has married an English girl.We had a set 2 course meal with a couple of glasses of red plus coffees which came to around Â£35 with a tip. We both had steak but I had a starter of rillettes de porc whilst the memsahib had a Greek salad with feta cheese - both were excellent as were the steaks. I saw a plate of creamed spinach going to another table and wished that we had also ordered a portion, but the whole meal was very good value.The set meals are great value but we must go back some time and spend more money for some moules along with a sirloin steak and a bottle of red, even if it means that I fall asleep at the matinee in the afternoon.","Yet again Tom and the guys served a wonderful Sunday roast. You cannot fault the food, service and Tom's wonderful Irish charm.One lamb roast, one half chicken, garlic roast potato's, fresh crunchy veg and plenty of gravy.Â£27 for two Sunday roasts and two desserts. Spend that in Toby or Harvester and the food will never be half as goodGoing to have to try a mid week meal, gammon, eggs and chips sounds just right!Please pop in and say hi to Tom, have a pint and a meal, you won't be disappointed.",We were given our own restaurant room and shared a number of meat and vegetarian dishes which were very good. With the surprise belly dancer - it made the whole evening worth it - just to see my friend's rather bemused faces. The lady who did the dancing was a good sport. Would I recommend this restaurant. yes but probably better for groups maybe rather than couples.,Perfect location if youre a tourist and fancy some food drinks or on your lunch. Sunday lunch was just right and waitress was so welcomin and effecient. Everyone who came in she greeted as she was serving ..lovely. good venue to watch some sport too and a perfect place to chill,"Situated in an iconic location, you can taste what real British food should be like. The staff is very friendly and gives elaborate explanations about what you can order. The food is served within a reasonable time and it tastes fresh. My ceasar salad was perfect and my husband enjoyed his steak a lot. The tomato soup is so good, makes you feel a child on a Sunday again.One thing you need to do is go to the toilet... Why? Well, maybe you'll finally know where 'crap' comes from. (Don't worry, the toilets are spic and span)",Good friendly service . Reasonable quality food. Menu would benefit from more detailed description of the food. Would also suggest they improve the presentation of the starters. On the downside the toilets smelled of cigarettes.,"It's funny when you have had a great experience to read other poor ones, however I have been the opposite position too, so I do understand. I got lucky, had the best steak ever. Food was great, service bang on, the restaurant was mobbed and very noisy, although the tables are close there is no way your neighbour would be able to hear your convo. I really loved it. Brilliant","Have visited Groucho for the first time, ""another steak for you "" Said my Wife,when you come to Groucho the best thing they have is a steak and they didn't disappoint.The Steaks where excellent, The service was excellent, a little loud in the restaurant due to the high number of people, but the steak was cooked to perfection."

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is defined as an investment involving a long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest in and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) of an enterprise resident in a different economy (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate). Such investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent transactions between them and among foreign affiliates.
FDI inflows and outflows comprise capital provided (either directly or through other related enterprises) by a foreign direct investor to a FDI enterprise, or capital received by a foreign direct investor from a FDI enterprise. FDI includes the three following components: equity capital, reinvested earnings and intra-company loans. Data on FDI flows are presented on net bases (capital transactions' credits less debits between direct investors and their foreign affiliates). Net decreases in assets or net increases in liabilities are recorded as credits, while net increases in assets or net decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits. Hence, FDI flows with a negative sign indicate that at least one of the three components of FDI is negative and not offset by positive amounts of the remaining components. These are called reverse investment or disinvestment.

Such investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent transactions between them and among foreign affiliates.
FDI stock is the value of the share of their capital and reserves (including retained profits) attributable to the parent enterprise, plus the net indebtedness of affiliates to the parent enterprises.","Coverage in terms of years, as well as data items, varies from country to country depending on data availability.

These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income.

National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies.

Almost all national poverty lines are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. The data is based on the two most recent years for which survey data are available.

Republican Bill Brief for: House Sub. SB42 

Date Passed Committee: 03/13/17 

 
 Bill Brief Author:  Rep. Jennings 
  
Sponsored by:  House Corrections & Juvenile Justice Committee 
 
A Bill Concerning:   Juvenile Offenders â Trailer Bill to 2016 SB 367 
 
What Bill Does:   This legislation makes changes to the juvenile offender code as revised in the 2016 session of 
the legislature through passage of SB 367. The original bill, HB 2466, contained one provision that altered the 
possible penalties for the use of a firearm during the commission of an offense by a juvenile.  HB 2466 bill was 
amended in committee and the contents of the amended bill were inserted into SB42.  The bill does the 
following: 
 

1.   Establishes a special sentencing rule for offenses where the juvenile uses a firearm in the commission of 
the offense.  The special sentencing rule will provide that upon a finding of the trier of fact that a firearm 
was used by the offender, the offender may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a 
minimum term of six months and a maximum term of 18 months regardless of whether the underlying 
offense committed would be an offense for which commitment to a correctional facility would otherwise 
be available. 

2.  Requires the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain a statewide searchable database that 

contains information regarding juvenile participation in immediate intervention programs.  Access to the 
database will be required to include county and district attorneys, judges, community supervision 
officers and juvenile intake and assessment officers.  

3.  Provides that when a juvenile offender absconds from supervision the act of absconding does not 

constitute a âtechnical violationâ of the conditions of supervision and upon reasonable efforts to locate 
the juvenile a warrant may be issued by the court. Current law requires three technical violations of 
supervision before revocation can occur.  Probation term limits and overall case length limits shall be 
tolled during the period that the offender absconded. 

4.  Defines the point in time in the proceeding of a juvenile offender case upon which the counting of days 

towards the imposed detention limitation of 45 days is calculated.  The count of detention days will 
commence upon disposition (sentencing) or 15 days following adjudication, whichever is sooner. 

5.  Changes the current limitation of 3 months to the total case time limit when removal of the offender 

from the home is necessary because the victim of a sex offense normally resides in the same residence as 
the offender. 

6.  Renames the juvenile justice improvement fund to the evidence-based program account of the state 
general fund and provides the Secretary of Corrections the ability to transfer funds projected to be 
available as a result of savings generated by juvenile justice reform when identified rather than the 
current method of annual transfer at the conclusion of the fiscal year.  Funds deposited in the evidence-
based program account remain out of reach for allotment by the Governor and are limited in their use for 
community programs and no other governmental purpose. 

7.  Incorporates identical language as found in the Code for Care of Children regarding specific findings 

with respect to reasonable efforts having been taken to avoid the out of home placement.  These findings 
are required to be made by the court upon an initial out of home placement in order to assure eligibility 
for federal IV -E support for juvenile offenders when placed out of home.  These findings in no way 

modify the findings required to be made by the court with respect to the initial order of out of home 
placement and only serve to supplement those findings in order to protect the interest of the state in 
assuring the highest level of federal funding available. 

8.  A technical change to eliminate duplicative language regarding required family reintegration efforts of 
the Department of Children and Family Services when a Child in Need of Care proceeding is ongoing 
during the term of a juvenile offender proceeding or dispositional case length limit period. 

9.  Changes the number, membership and role of the Kansas Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee.  The 

number of members is increased from 19 to 21.  The two additional members include one member 
appointed by the Chair of the Kansas Advisory Group (KAG) on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention from the youth membership of the KAG. The second additional member is a detention center 
director appointed by the Attorney General. The duties of the committee are expanded to include 
creating a plan to address the mental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system and review the 
collaborative work of the Department of Corrections and the Office of Judicial Administration and make 
recommendations when there is not consensus between the two.  

10. Includes certain modifications to the law pertaining to Immediate Intervention Programs (IIP) (formerly 

known as diversion agreements) 

a.  Provides that permitting participation in an IIP for a misdemeanor sex offense is within the 

discretion of the prosecutor and not automatically available to the offender. 

b.  In the case of a juvenile who is originally charged with a felony offense and a plea agreement is 

reached for a plea to a misdemeanor, the offender is not automatically entitled to an IIP if the 
offense constitutes a first-time misdemeanor offense.  Participation in an IIP would be within the 
discretion of the prosecutor. 

c.  The prosecutor may exclude an offender from mandatory participation in an IIP when the 

prosecutor declines prosecution. 

d.  Mandatory availability of an IIP for a misdemeanor offense will apply only to the first event of a 

misdemeanor violation.  Second or subsequent instances of misdemeanor violations, when the 
offender has previously participated in an IIP, the prosecutor will have discretion to permit 
additional instances of participation in an IIP.  

11.  Amends the placement matrix statute (version effective July 1, 2017) to consolidate the categories of 

serious offender III and serious offender IV, which carry the same risk-level requirements and JCF 
commitment terms, into a single serious offender III category. 

 
Political Reality/Implications:   Affords prosecutors and judges greater discretion in certain circumstances, 
holds youth accountable for their behavior in ways appropriate to their developmental stage and enhances 
public safety through providing evidence-based interventions within the community that change behavior of 
offending youth. 
 
Committee Amendments:   Yes 
 
Possible Floor Amendments:  Yes - but none known now.

*Note:  The process method used to construct the bill was not particularly conducive for conferees to indicate 
status as a proponent, opponent or neutral.  All presenting are being reported as a conferee. A brief summary of 
their position is provided.  Their full written testimony is available on the legislative website under the 
Correction and Juvenile Justice Committee minutes tab.  
 
Fiscal Note:   No fiscal implications outside of agency existing resources.  Incremental expense in an unknown 
amount may be incurred because of the IIP database requirement.  However, it is contemplated this component 
of data may be added to an existing information management system program without significant expense.  
Some lost savings as a result of expanding the offenses in which a firearm is used to allow for juvenile 
correctional facility commitment may occur. 
 
Who will carry the bill:   Rep. Jennings 
 
Is this bill ready to run on the floor?  Yes

Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 45-220 is hereby amended to read as follows: 45-220. (a) Each public agency shall adopt procedures to be followed in requesting 
access to and obtaining copies of public records, which procedures shall provide full access to public records, protect public records from damage and 
disorganization, prevent excessive disruption of the agency's essential functions, provide assistance and information upon request and insure efficient and timely 
action in response to applications for inspection of public records. 
(b)(cid:3025)A public agency may require a written request for inspection of public records but shall not otherwise require a request to be made in any particular form. 
Except as otherwise provided by subsection (c), a public agency shall not require that a request contain more information than the requester's name and address
and the information necessary to ascertain the records to which the requester desires access and the requester's right of access to the records. A public agency 
may require proof of identity of any person requesting access to a public record. No request shall be returned, delayed or denied because of any technicality 
unless it is impossible to determine the records to which the requester desires access. 
(c)(cid:3025)If access to public records of an agency or the purpose for which the records may be used is limited pursuant to K.S.A. 45-221 or K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 
45-230, and amendments thereto, the agency may require a person requesting the records or information therein to provide written certification that: 
(1)(cid:3025)The requester has a right of access to the records and the basis of that right; or 
(2)(cid:3025)the requester does not intend to, and will not: (A) Use any list of names or addresses contained in or derived from the records or information for the purpose
of selling or offering for sale any property or service to any person listed or to any person who resides at any address listed; or (B) sell, give or otherwise make
available to any person any list of names or addresses contained in or derived from the records or information for the purpose of allowing that person to sell or
offer for sale any property or service to any person listed or to any person who resides at any address listed. 
(d)(cid:3025)A public agency shall establish, for business days when it does not maintain regular office hours, reasonable hours when persons may inspect and obtain
copies of the agency's records. The public agency may require that any person desiring to inspect or obtain copies of the agency's records during such hours so
notify the agency, but such notice shall not be required to be in writing and shall not be required to be given more than 24 hours prior to the hours established for
inspection and obtaining copies. 
(e)(cid:3025)Each official custodian of public records shall designate such persons as necessary to carry out the duties of custodian under this act and shall ensure that a
custodian is available during regular business hours of the public agency to carry out such duties. 
(f)(cid:3025)Each public agency shall provide, upon request of any person, the following information: 
(1)(cid:3025)The principal office of the agency, its regular office hours and any additional hours established by the agency pursuant to subsection (c). 
(2)(cid:3025)The title and address of the official custodian of the agency's records and of any other custodian who is ordinarily available to act on requests made at the
location where the information is displayed. 
(3)(cid:3025)The fees, if any, charged for access to or copies of the agency's records. 
(4)(cid:3025)The procedures to be followed in requesting access to and obtaining copies of the agency's records, including procedures for giving notice of a desire to
inspect or obtain copies of records during hours established by the agency pursuant to subsection (c). 
(g)  (1)(cid:3025)Except  for  requests  of  summary  data  compiled  from  information  submitted  by  multiple  criminal  justice  agencies  or  as  otherwise  provided  by  law,
requests for records submitted to the central repository or any other repositories supporting the criminal justice information system which are maintained by the 
Kansas bureau of investigation pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4704 and 22-4705, and amendments thereto, shall be directed to the criminal justice agency from which 
the records originated. 
(h) (2)(cid:3025)As used in this section subsection, the terms ""central repository,"" ""criminal justice agency"" and ""criminal justice information system"" have the same
meanings as defined in K.S.A. 22-4701, and amendments thereto. 
(h)(cid:3025)Requests for records defined as ""files"" pursuant to section 1, and amendments thereto, submitted to a state or local law enforcement agency or 
governmental agency shall be directed to the state or local law enforcement agency or governmental agency that made, maintained or kept such files, as required 
by section 1, and amendments thereto. 
Sec. 3.(cid:3025)K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 45-220 is hereby repealed.

Perguntei onde estava essa regra no site , a mesma disse que tinha no regulamento mas nao mostrou. Depois de meia hora de conversa perguntei se a garantia podia ser em DINHEIRO e a mesma disse que NAO.. depois foi perguntar a um superior , onde disse que poderia ser. FuncionÃ¡ria totalmente mecÃ¢nica e invasiva queria saber quanto em dinheiro tÃ­nhamos trazido para viajem . Enfim.. tivemls que deixar 500 reais para entrar num hotel cuja a diÃ¡ria tinha sido paga Ã¡ vista ppr uma agÃªncia de viagens.

Enfim, estragou nossa viagem, que era pra ser romÃ¢ntica.","Vc estÃ¡ em um hotel Ã  beira mar em Natal e nÃ£o tem um sequer peixe fresco! Tudo requentado em todos os restaurantes. NÃ£o tem aperitivos do mar. Nada. Comida horrÃ­vel. Atendimento fraquÃ­ssimo, instalaÃ§Ãµes que presumem ser luxuosas mas muito fracas.

Fui a negÃ³cios e aproveitei pouco a beleza das praias, mas aproveitei bastante a pousada. Bom cafÃ© da manhÃ£, boas acomodaÃ§Ãµes, vale muito a pena.","Estive na pousada no perÃ­odo de 09 a 13/05, para o Congresso dos Guias de Turismo.

Accusations everyday she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored he's on his own time
Shoulda' ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her tryna' flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she's all alone and starting over
Now she's got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him but she doesn't trust herself anymore
She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
Despite her past she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten' up since
Every now and then she goes off though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call a hoe after hang ups
Gives her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted
She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
","Yo conozco su cara y conozco su alma
Que no hay gente mÃ¡s buena que yo haya visto en otro lugar
Es mi pueblo, es mi herencia
Que me dio mi bandera
Que se alegra la vida cuando un domingo sale a pasear
No se queda en su cama
Se le nota en las ganas
Y aunque no ha amanecido muy tempranito sale a entrenar
Es un noble guerrero, un halcÃ³n montaÃ±ero
Que sube ligero y en las montaÃ±as se ve reinar
Se lo digo yo, que me lleva el llanto
Esa es la emociÃ³n de ser colombiano
Gracias mi tierra querida te doy las gracias

","Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention when you ask for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be lost, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked them into letting me go
It's no Picasso, Michelangelo
Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the Masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
If suddenly you're out of the woods
Then inside of an alley you're out of words
Well I thought it was radium at first
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no one else to blame
For us two
Some things they don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth is we're all to blame
There are lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll
Something 'bout how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed
And I laughed and you left and I left?
Send me on the lonely other side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through

","Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my carbon
I sit back and read, like Cat in the hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough

'Til a nigga get spilled,
'Til your blood get spilled

Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked

There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

And the stars, they broke their code

I'm caught in between

I would like to address you first. I did not kill your loved one, but I hope that one day you find out who did. I wish I could tell you the reason why, or give some kind of solace; you lost someone you love very much. The same as my family and friends are going to lose in a few minutes. I am sure he died unjustly, just like I am. I did not murder him; I did not have anything to do with his death. And to you my family and friends, I love you dearly. Even though I die, that love for you will never die. Into Your hands, Lord, I commit my spirit. Thank you. Thank you all. ","I am saying, I want y'all to keep your heads up, hold on and stay strong for everybody. I mean ah, I don't want y'all to look at me like I am a killer or something man, cause I ain't no killer. I mean, I didn't, I didn't kill your father. I mean, I know how it look, but I didn't do it. You know what I am saying? You were out there with me, Tommy. I mean, you know man. (mumbled) You know I always did want to say something to y'all. Right? I can't say that I done it because I didn't do it. I've got love for everybody. I am a Christian now. I'm saying I want everybody to keep thier heads up and stay strong. I'm going to stay strong. I'll be seeing you, this is my last breath. Ricky, keep your head up baby. All y'all, Doreen, Melodee. I mean, I know y'all don't come down here. I just really don't know what y'all want me to say. I mean, I know, ah, I mean, I'm sorry anybody, ah, anybody got killed that night. It wasn't supposed to happen, but I didn't do it. I really didn't do it. I don't want y'all to go through life thinking that I did. You know what I am saying? I love everybody and I want y'all to stay strong. Right? It would take me an hour or a long time, man, but, ah, man, I don't want to hold y'all up, man, like that, ah. Y'all just keep your head up and stay strong, man. Give my love to everybody. I love y'all.  "," Yes. I would like to address the victim's family. I received your poem and I am very grateful for your forgiveness. I still want to ask for it anyway. I have Jesus in my heart and I am sorry for any pain I caused you all. Thank you for your forgiveness. I am sorry. Ashlee, Pam -- I am going to miss you all. I love you all. Give everybody my love. Give everybody my love, O.K.? Mother, James, Justin, Corey, Brent, grand-babies and Daddy - I love you Pam. I love you Ashlee, Pammy and Irene. I will see you all on the other side. Couple friends on death row who have helped me; Shy Town and Crazy Jay...I love you all and for all your support. Uncle Ray too. I am saved and I am going home, O.K.? You all stay strong. You all stay strong. That is all.  "," Yes I do. Um Abel, Love ya'll, Evelyn love ya'll, Armando and Delia I love ya'll. Do what I told you and you will see me one day. Do that and promise me. First, Veronica's sister. I know what you've been told and that's all a lie. John Gomez killed your kids and sister. I know ya'll love John Gomez but he was a violent man. I wish I would have shot him in the leg, then he would be here. Those investigators were just trying to convict somebody. My gun had a hair trigger. Veronica told me to come and get my herb book and she went to the back of the closet. Her kids had asthma and I lent her the book. She said she would give it to me next time. She didn't want to break up, we still talked. She told me to come over. John Gomez said Veronica does not have the money for your book so don't come over. Me being a hot shot I went over there and I had my gun. I had children and nephews where I lived so I had to keep my gun in my truck for self defense. Veronica invited me in her house, the kids were still awake fixing to go to bed. I put the gun under my shirt and said Hi to Josh and Cassandra. John Gomez was there he told Veronica that ""he doesn't love you"" I didn't care.  "," Ah, just ah sorry ya'll. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya'll to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that apologize to you. I'm real sorry for it. I was raised by the California Youth Authority, I can't really pin point where it started, what happened but really believe that's just the bottom line, what happened to me was in California. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but ah they create monsters in there. That's it, I have nothing else to say. Thanks for coming Jack.  ","Life is death, death is life. I hope that someday this absurdity that humanity has come to will come to and an end. Life is too short. I hope that anyone that has negative energy towards me will resolve that. Life is too short to harbor feelings of hatred and anger. That's it.","I would like to thank everyone that has showed up on my  behalf, Kathryn Cox, I love you dearly.åÊ Thank you Randy Cannon for  showing up and being a lifelong friend.åÊ Thank you Dr. Steve Ball for  trying to bring the right out.åÊ There are a lot of injustices that are  happening with this.åÊ This is wrong.åÊ Thank you Reverend Leon  Harrison for showing me the grace of God.åÊ Thank you for all of my friends  that are out there.åÊ This is not a capital case.åÊ I never had  intended to do anything.åÊ I feel very grieved for the loss of Walker, and  for Donovan and Marissa Walker.åÊ I hope they can find peace and be  productive in society.åÊ I would like to thank all of my friends on the row  even though everything didnÛªt work, close isnÛªt good enough.åÊ I hope that  positive change will come out of this.","Yes sir. To Edie, Tom, and and Carma - I love all you all.  I appreciate all your support.  I love you Margherita, Father Guido, and Father Angelo.  I appreciate your spiritual support and all those that were in prayer for me.  I will be O.K.  I am at peace with all of this and I won't have to wake up in prison any more.  I love you all.  I totally surrender to the Lord.  I am ready, Warden. ","Spoken: To all my family and friends, I want you to know that I love you very much.  I appreciate all the good and bad times together.  I'll always remember you, and love you forever.  And to the West family, I hope you can find it in your heart to find forgiveness and strength, to move on and find peace."," I'd like to send great love to all my family members, my supporters, my attorneys. They have all supported me throughout this. I thank you for proving my innocence, although it has not been acknowledged by the courts. May you continue in the struggle and may you change all that's being done here today and in the past. Life has not been that good to me, but I believe that now, after meeting so many people who support me in this, that all things will come to an end, and may this be fruit of better judgments for the future. That's all I have to say.  "

Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.  But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",I did not support the war in Iraq.,"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States."
