Closer ties, Mr. Trudeau says, would release untapped prosperity at home and promote Canadian values like good governance and the rule of law in China. But many say the opposite is happening. They say the growing economic clout wielded in Canada by China, Canada‚Äôs largest trading partner after the United States, is leading to an erosion of their own freedom ‚Äî specifically their freedom to speak openly about China‚Äôs authoritarian state. Journalists who write for the many publications in Canada, along with activists and others, say they are under increasing pressure to promote the interests of the Chinese government. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotten worse and worse,‚Äù said Jonathan Fon, 67, a Toronto paralegal, freelance writer and critic of China‚Äôs Communist rulers. Mr. Fon, who emigrated from China in 1992, said publications that had once printed his opinion articles now routinely rejected them because of worries about political and financial fallout. ‚ÄúThey will not take my contributions, even though we‚Äôre friends,‚Äù he said. In the past decade, China has embarked on an ambitious effort to promote its image abroad, including a overseas expansion by Chinese state media and a network of Confucius Institutes, which teach Chinese language and culture while disseminating the Communist Party‚Äôs viewpoints. In Western countries, analysts say, the party exerts influence over Chinese immigrants and students through embassies, consulates and community organizations, as well as business interests with the financial leverage to shape local media coverage. ‚ÄúChina is not shy about using overseas Chinese communities to advance its interests abroad,‚Äù said Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College in California. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs brilliant about the Chinese government‚Äôs interest strategy is that it exploits the freedoms of Western democracies against Western democracies. ‚Äù Even some Canadian officials who are eager for closer ties have weighed in, expressing support for Beijing on human rights and trying to discourage negative coverage of China. That has provoked anger in Canada, where many see China as a threat to their way of life, and underscored the challenge faced by Mr. Trudeau, who took office in November, as he seeks more engagement after a decade of sometimes chilly ties under his predecessor. Mr. Trudeau‚Äôs weeklong visit will culminate in a Group of 20 economic summit meeting in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. But his trip is also intended to help Canadian businesses gain greater market access to China‚Äôs growing middle class, encourage Chinese capital investment in Canada, and attract Chinese tourists and university students to Canada. The Canadian foreign minister, St√©phane Dion, said in an interview that the government‚Äôs pursuit of closer engagement with nondemocratic countries, including China, would allow it to promote human rights while protecting Canadian interests. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try to make sure that Canada will be part of the solution, to make these countries more free than they are today,‚Äù he said. Asked about complaints that Beijing was putting pressure on Mr. Dion said he and Mr. Trudeau were ‚Äúvery strongly against any attempt to muzzle public opinion in Canada. ‚Äù He noted that many were clearly not afraid to criticize Beijing. But recent events have kept the issue in the spotlight. In June, during a news conference in Ottawa, China‚Äôs visiting foreign minister, Wang Yi, berated a Canadian reporter for asking Mr. Dion a question about human rights in China. ‚ÄúYou have no right to speak of this,‚Äù Mr. Wang said. A week later, Michael Chan, a who was Ontario‚Äôs provincial minister of citizenship, immigration and international trade, defended China‚Äôs human rights practices in a column on a Canadian website, 51. ca. Making no mention of China‚Äôs use of torture, illegal detention or other systemic abuses, Mr. Chan argued that China‚Äôs rights record should be viewed positively, in the context of economic development. ‚ÄúPeople are living with freedom,‚Äù he wrote, praising Beijing for improving Chinese people‚Äôs ‚Äúbasic livelihood,‚Äù allowing them to travel and study abroad. Outrage soon followed both officials‚Äô remarks ‚Äî as did consequences for some writers who criticized them. A Chinese writer said he had lost his column in the Global Chinese Press, based in British Columbia, after the newspaper was pressured over his criticism of Mr. Wang and Mr. Chan, according to a report in The Globe and Mail. A freelancer in Toronto who uses the pen name Xin Feng received death threats online for chastising Mr. Wang in a column. ‚ÄúBe careful that your whole family doesn‚Äôt get killed,‚Äù one person posted. ‚ÄúBe careful when you walk outside!‚Äù A year ago, the editor in chief of a newspaper in Ontario said she had been fired for publishing a commentary critical of Mr. Chan. She blamed that, in part, on complaints from the Chinese consulate in Toronto. In Ontario, which includes Toronto and its suburbs, journalists and media executives say has become widespread because of the economic pressures on their outlets. They fear boycotts by advertisers and the loss of distribution deals with Chinese state media publications. Ontario has more than 30 news outlets, mostly free newspapers, and the majority of them appear to avoid reporting that would anger China‚Äôs leaders. Jack Jia, 54, the publisher of the Chinese News Group newspaper and website, said China‚Äôs influence had ‚Äúgrown stronger and stronger‚Äù in recent years. ‚ÄúThey want to control everything,‚Äù Mr. Jia said. He said China‚Äôs consul general in Toronto and her deputy had asked him several years ago to stop publishing ads from practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned as an ‚Äúevil cult‚Äù in China. He refused. Today, he said, as immigration from China has soared, Chinese officials have gained more leverage. ‚ÄúThey can threaten, because most media employees have family back in China,‚Äù Mr. Jia said. A reporter in Toronto, who asked not to be identified in order to protect her job and her relatives in China, said her editors now regularly deleted quotations that were critical of Beijing, and reviewed article ideas specifically to head off coverage that might reflect poorly on the Chinese government. ‚ÄúWhen I came to Canada, I felt some freedom, but now there are so many restrictions,‚Äù the reporter said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere now. ‚Äù A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa declined to answer questions about China‚Äôs involvement with ethnic Chinese communities in Canada. Political attitudes vary widely among the roughly 1. 5 million ethnic Chinese living in Canada. While pride in their heritage is widespread, many bristle at what they say is mounting pressure to express loyalty to Beijing, both from local media and from other . ‚ÄúAs a Canadian, you should share Canadian values ‚Äî freedom, democracy and human rights,‚Äù said Harry Xu, 54, a Toronto real estate broker who emigrated from China 10 years ago. ‚ÄúThese principles are important to us, but some Chinese immigrants are confused. ‚Äù Activists in Canada critical of Beijing have found themselves targets for intimidation. Not long after Zang Xihong, 54, a prominent Chinese activist, emigrated to Canada 27 years ago, she said, she began receiving menacing phone calls from Chinese state security agents at her home in the Toronto suburbs. In recent years, she said, the harassment has grown more ominous. Her face and phone numbers have been digitally inserted into pornographic escort ads, she said hackers have posted photos stolen from her computer and articles have appeared online accusing her of embezzlement. She has also been sued by a man who claims she was responsible for his cousin‚Äôs death in China. Ms. Zang said the Canadian authorities had told her that they could take no action because most of those activities were protected free speech, leaving her powerless, she said, to escape the long arm of the Chinese government or its supporters. ‚ÄúWhen I fled from China, I suddenly realized they are here already,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhere else can I go?‚Äù","‚Äô ‚Äô ‚Äô Donald Trump will Gary Cohn, the longtime chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, the director of the National Economic Council. ‚Äô ‚Äô If you‚Äôre keeping count, that would be another Goldman alum in Trump‚Äôs orbit, in addition to: former Goldman banker (and former Breitbart honcho) Steve Bannon, set to be a key White House adviser; former Goldman Steven Mnuchin, who will head the treasury; and former Goldman banker Anthony Scaramucci, now a key transition adviser. ‚Äô ‚Äô Is it a betrayal to hire men like Cohn, who the last time I saw in person was a bartender at Davos? ‚Äô ‚Äô After all, Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for giving highly compensated speeches to the investment bank and trashed Sen. Ted Cruz because his wife worked there, and a scaremongering about current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein looked as if it might have first run in the ‚Äô ‚Äô So, yes, you could read Cohn‚Äôs appointment as another sign of hypocrisy, more proof that the Trump campaign was just a carny act. But it‚Äôs also something else: a sign that some aspects of the system are working exactly as they‚Äôre supposed to, and long have. ‚Äô ‚Äô Cohn, a veteran of the firm, is very much a central cog in the global financial establishment. And in accepting the position, Cohn is simply following a path. Government service ‚Äî particularly the National Economic Council ‚Äî is what top Goldman executives do when their careers have run their course. ‚Äô ‚Äô The National Economic Council was created during the first year of the Clinton administration. Its inaugural director was the of Goldman Sachs who was an influential early Clinton adviser. After two years at NEC, Rubin was promoted to Treasury Secretary. Rubin‚Äôs partner in running Goldman in the 1990s was . Friedman left the firm in 1994 but in 2002 was named to succeed Larry Lindsey as ‚Äî yup ‚Äî director of President George W. Bush‚Äôs National Economic Council. ‚Äô ‚Äô Friedman and Rubin were succeeded at the helm of Goldman by Jon Corzine, who went on to run successfully for U. S. Senate and then governor after he was ousted in 1998. Corzine was replaced by Henry Paulson, who had been the chief operating officer. And when Paulson‚Äôs time at chief executive at Goldman came to an end, he skipped the NEC and went directly to the Treasury Department (thus forcing me into the public humiliation of . ). ‚Äô ‚Äô ‚Äô ‚Äô Unlike Paulson or the other Goldman execs who went on to head the NEC, Cohn never made it to the top. Indeed, one of the strange features of the past several years has been a certain stasis at the head of America‚Äôs largest financial institutions. Jamie Dimon has been running JPMorgan Chase for 12 years, through crisis, cancer, and a mammoth list of fines, yet shows no signs of giving up. Brian Moynihan is completing his sixth year as CEO as Bank of America. And Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, is now entering his second decade in the role. ‚Äô ‚Äô One could have imagined Blankfein taking a job in the Clinton administration. (His beard, and liberal social views mark him as a Democrat.) But the results of the November election foreclosed that option. For an ambitious heir apparent at Goldman, which Cohn has been for the past several years, the only way up is out. ‚Äô ‚Äô Like many of those who thrive at Goldman, Cohn is affable in public; tough, in private; political but not particularly ideological. A graduate of American University, Cohn is a little bit like the brawnier younger brother to Blankfein. ‚Äô ‚Äô Cohn made and left his mark first as a trader, and then as the chief operating officer, making sure the highly functional bureaucracy of the global banking giant runs efficiently and managing internal rivalries ‚Äî not as a strategist or the public face of the firm. ‚Äô ‚Äô ‚Äô ‚Äô The National Economic Council is a much different type of operation. It‚Äôs a and influence sorter. As such, it is perfect for habitu√©s of what used to be a secretive private partnership. It doesn‚Äôt have a large workforce of offices to manage. The director doesn‚Äôt have to be bothered much with operations, personnel, and pointless meetings. The job is twofold. First, the NEC director serves as one of the administration‚Äôs whisperers ‚Äî talking to CEOs, drumming up outside support for policies, providing comfort to executives who might be concerned about the president‚Äôs policies and behavior. Second, the director functions as a sort of traffic cop and counselor for the conflicting power centers of policy and analysis within the administration. The job consists largely of sitting in very nice conference rooms, entertaining visitors seeking favors, attending conferences, cajoling peers, participating in phone calls, and leaking selectively to favored press. ‚Äô ‚Äô It‚Äôs kind of like being the CEO of a big investment bank ‚Äî except without the big salary ‚Äô","‚Äô‚Äô ‚ÄôCannabis is a serious business. ‚Äô ‚ÄùCurrently, medical marijuana is legal in with several more considering bills. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, estimates that it‚Äôs a industry in the US alone. ‚Äù ‚ÄôThis year, the International Cannabis Association hosted the Cannabis World Congress and Business Exposition in New York City, where cannabis businesses from around the world can network, show off their products, and attend seminars and panel discussions about the burgeoning industry.‚Äô ‚ÄôTake a look at what went down inside the conference.‚Äô ‚ÄôCannabis is a serious business. ..‚Äô","Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lead in the popular vote is growing. She is roughly 30, 000 votes behind Donald J. Trump in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin ‚Äî a combined gap that is narrowing. Her impassioned supporters are now urging her to challenge the results in those two states and Pennsylvania, grasping at the last straws to reverse Mr. Trump‚Äôs decisive majority in the Electoral College. In recent days, they have seized on a report by a respected computer scientist and other experts suggesting that Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the keys to Mr. Trump‚Äôs Electoral College victory, need to manually review paper ballots to assure the election was not hacked. ‚ÄúWere this year‚Äôs deviations from polls the results of a cyberattack?‚Äù J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan who has studied the vulnerabilities of election systems at length, wrote on Medium on Wednesday as the calls based on his conclusions mounted. ‚ÄúProbably not. ‚Äù More likely, he wrote, polls were ‚Äúsystematically wrong. ‚Äù But the only way to resolve the lingering questions would be to examine ‚Äúpaper ballots and voting equipment in critical states,‚Äù he wrote. Tellingly, the pleas for recounts have gained no support from the Clinton campaign, which has concluded, along with outside experts, that it is highly unlikely the outcome would change even after an expensive and review of ballots. But that has not quieted Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs supporters, who see the inequity of her growing lead in the national popular vote, which is now more than two million votes, or 1. 5 percent of all ballots cast, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which regularly updates its count as states continue to tally and to certify votes. Since there is currently no effort to review the paper ballots ‚Äî which exist in Michigan and Wisconsin, but only in parts of Pennsylvania ‚Äî conspiracy theories about the 2016 election may live on for years. After United States intelligence agencies accused Russia of trying to influence the election by stealing and publishing emails from the Democratic National Committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals, the United States went on high alert to determine if there was any attempt to sabotage the vote count. So far, no one in the Obama administration has indicated that there is any such evidence. In the three battleground states, Mrs. Clinton is behind by 1. 2 percent or less, and the final results have not yet been certified. Uniting around the social media hashtag #AuditTheVote, the has picked up momentum among activists still mourning Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory and who echo, paradoxically, his complaint that the vote was ‚Äúrigged. ‚Äù ‚ÄúBased on the information of the intelligence community that Russia was actively trying to screw around with our election, I thought why not take the time and question this,‚Äù said Michelle an engineer in Pittsburgh, who on Wednesday planned to petition her county election board for a recount of the Nov. 8 vote. That view spread quickly on social media on Tuesday evening when New York magazine published an article about Professor Halderman and others who had contacted the remnants of the Clinton campaign. It also generated pushback by experts who said that even though it was theoretically possible to hack voting machines, it would be enormously difficult ‚Äî because it would have to be highly targeted in key precincts and conducted on a scale required to assure Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory. ‚Äú conspiracy theories of vote rigging‚Äù are ‚Äúpathetic,‚Äù Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report said on Twitter. Time may have already run out. Pennsylvania allows individual voters to petition for a recount, but the deadline was Sunday, said Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State. A candidate can also contest an election in court, and the deadline is Monday. Michigan and Wisconsin have not reached their deadlines for seeking a recount, but they will in days. So far, Mrs. Clinton has not requested any action, said Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Until the publication of Professor Halderman‚Äôs work, Clinton supporters had few reasons to hope. He did not offer them much: He noted that while the voting machines used in those states are not connected to the internet during the election, they are programmed before the election. The data is usually transferred on a USB stick or other data card. ‚ÄúIf attackers can modify that software by infecting the machines with malware, they can cause the machines to give any answer whatsoever,‚Äù Professor Halderman wrote. The problem, as Bruce Schneier, a security expert who has written often on the issue, noted in an interview, is that the usual triggers for a recount ‚Äî a very close margin between two candidates ‚Äî make little sense in a world of computer hackings. A truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount. Mrs. Clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the Electoral College. The electors will meet in December to formally choose the president. And there, Mr. Trump is ahead by 290 votes to Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs 232, with Michigan still officially uncalled. As of Wednesday, Mr. Trump‚Äôs lead in Michigan had shrunk to 10, 704 votes, or 0. 2 percent, according to the National Popular Vote Tracker maintained by the Cook Political Report. Mr. Trump‚Äôs lead in Wisconsin has narrowed to 22, 525 votes, or 0. 8 percent. In Pennsylvania, his lead slightly grew on Wednesday, to 70, 010, or 1. 2 percent. The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Other Democrats said it was time to move on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs possible to undo the results, and all the people are focusing their energy on opposing the worst ideas of this administration at this point, not the legitimacy of the results,‚Äù said Daniel Doubet, an organizer for Keystone Progress, a liberal group in Pennsylvania. Those pushing for a recount say they are trying to pick up the fight for a tired and demoralized candidate and her staff. ‚ÄúThe Democratic Party and the Hillary campaign are exhausted, and they‚Äôre really hurting, and they may not have the clarity,‚Äù said Ms. who briefly volunteered for the Clinton campaign. On social media, supporters pleaded with the campaign to act. ‚ÄúPlease @HillaryClinton @timkaine call for #AuditTheVote,‚Äù wrote Writerchick on Twitter, appealing to Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. ‚ÄúWe are all working so hard for you, make the call, the nation is depending on you. ‚Äù By poring over local election results online, the Audit the Vote crowd uncovered what appeared to be anomalies in the counting. Helen Manich of National Harbor, Md. for one, noticed that Sauk County, Wis. reported that 31, 838 ballots were cast overall, but the total votes for presidential candidates numbered 34, 323. Such glitches are not uncommon, election experts said. They are usually ironed out in the process of certifying results. Although those certifications might change the results by several hundred or several thousand votes, they are highly unlikely to move tens of thousands. To shift the Electoral College, Mrs. Clinton would not only have to reverse her current deficits in Wisconsin and Michigan but also in Pennsylvania, which experts say is highly unlikely. There is widespread confusion on social media about how recounts are generated. A flood of Twitter users have urged Clinton supporters to call the United States Department of Justice, even though it is states that certify election results. Ms. was furiously trying to organize voters around the states to file petitions demanding a recount this week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like this fever approach happening in the last few hours,‚Äù Melissa Lang of Allegheny County, Pa. said on Tuesday, describing her efforts to reach out to voters across the state using social media. But Ms. Murren, the Pennsylvania State Department spokeswoman, said the deadline for such petitions had come and gone. ‚ÄúOur staff is not aware of any petitions for recounts in the presidential race,‚Äù she said.","Sunday at the University of Notre Dame graduation ceremony in South Bend, IN, dozens of students marched out of the stadium moments after Vice President Mike Pence took the stage.

 When we start to rock

 We know our fans are insane
 We are gonna blow this place away
 With volume higher
 Than anything today the only way
 When we start to rock

 Better raise your ears
 The sound of hooves knock at your door
 Lock up your wife and children now
 It's time to wield the blade
 For now you have got some company

 The Horsemen are drawing nearer
 On leather steeds they ride
 They've come to take your life
 On through the dead of night
 With the Four Horsemen ride
 Or choose your fate and die

 You have been dying since the day you were born
 You know it has all been planned
 The quartet of deliverance rides
 A sinner once a sinner twice
 No need for confessions now
 Cause now you have got the fight of your life

 The Horsemen are drawing nearer
 On leather steeds they ride
 They've come to take your life
 On through the dead of night
 With the Four Horsemen ride
 Or choose your fate and die

 Time
 Has taken its toll on you
 The lines that crack your face
 Famine
 Your body it has torn through
 Withered in every place
 Pestilence
 For what you have had to endure
 And what you have put others through
 Death
 Deliverance for you for sure
 Now there is nothing you can do

 So gather round young warriors now
 And saddle up your steeds
 Killing scores with demon swords
 Now is the death of doers of wrong
 Swing the judgement hammer down
 Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

 The Horsemen are drawing nearer
 On leather steeds they ride
 They've come to take your life
 On through the dead of night
 With the Four Horsemen ride
 Or choose your fate and die 

","Living and dying laughing and crying
 Once you have seen it you will never be the same
 Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
 Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

 Motorbreath
 It's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath
 The sign of living fast
 It is going to take
 Your breath away

 Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
 I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
 Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
 Sending the shivers up and down my spine

 Motorbreath
 It's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath
 The sign of living fast
 It is going to take
 Your breath away

 Those people who tell you not to take chances
 They are all missing on what life is about
 You only live once so take hold of the chance
 Don't end up like others the same song and dance

 Motorbreath
 It's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath
 The sign of living fast
 It is going to take
 Your breath away 

","Down in the depths of my fiery home
 The summons bell will chime
 Tempting you and all the earth
 to join our sinful kind
 There is a job to be done and I'm the one
 You people make me do it
 Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
 to pull you down into this pit

 So come on
 Jump in the Fire
 So come on
 Jump in the Fire

 With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
 The end is closing in
 Feeding on the minds of man
 and from their souls within
 My disciples all shout to search you out
 And they always shall obey
 Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
 But do just as I say

 So come on
 Jump in the Fire
 So come on
 Jump in the Fire

 Jump by your will or be taken by force
 I'll get you either way
 Trying to keep the hellfire lit
 I am stalking you as prey
 Living your life as me I am you you see
 There is part of me in everyone
 So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
 Come home where you belong

 So come on

The PHI included names, telephone numbers, detailed treatment notes, and possibly social security numbers.  In response to the breach, the covered entity (CE) sanctioned the workforce member and developed a new policy requiring on-call staff members to submit any information created during their shifts to the main office instead of adding it to the binder.  Following OCR's investigation, the CE notified the local media about the breach.","Five desktop computers containing unencrypted electronic protected health information (e-PHI) were stolen from the covered entity (CE).  Originally, the CE reported that over 500 persons were involved, but subsequent investigation showed that about 260 persons were involved.  The ePHI included demographic and financial information. The CE provided breach notification to affected individuals and HHS.  Following the breach, the CE improved physical security by installing motion detectors and alarm systems security monitoring.  It improved technical safeguards by installing enhanced antivirus and encryption software.  As a result of OCR's investigation the CE updated its computer password policy.

The protected health information involved in the breach included names, Medicaid ID numbers, dates of birth, and primary physicians.  In response to this incident, the covered entity took steps to enforce the requirements of the Privacy & Security Rules.  The covered entity has installed encryption software on all employee computers, strengthened access controls including passwords, reviewed and updated security policies and procedures, and updated it risk assessment.  In addition, all employees received additional security training.

The Computer contained certain electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 5,257 individuals who were patients of the CE.  The ePHI involved in the breach included names, dates of birth, and clinical information, but there were no social security numbers, financial information, addresses, phone numbers, or other ePHI in any of the reports on the disks or the hard drive on the stolen Computer. Following the breach, the covered entity notified all 5,257 affected individuals and the appropriate media; added technical safeguards of encryption for all ePHI stored on the USB flash drive or the CD used on the replacement computer; added physical safeguards by keeping new portable devices locked when not in use in a secure combination safe in doctor's private office or in a secure filing cabinet; and added administrative safeguards by requiring annual refresher retraining of CE staff for Privacy and Security Rules as well as requiring immediate retraining of cleaning staff in both Rules.

preLoad), and also to be able to pass through the call to the original recipient of chrome.send.The use case is for an async test to catch the chrome.send message to end the test and also have it send to the underlying C++ to clean up after itself.Technically this is possible with mocking at the C++ layer, but writing in JavaScript keeps your attention closer to the test writing surrounding UI which is more similar than code in the handler.","I'm hitting this assertion on most sites (most recently on codereview.chromium.org):ASSERTION FAILED:

However, this is not because the organization is experiencing an unusually high number of borrowers behind on repayment. To lower the costs of transferring funds, Kiva allows its partners to wait until repayments exceed $5,000 to repay. For small institutions like Maya that have a low outstanding balance with Kiva, this delay sometimes results in higher delinquency rates.","Kiva is unable to provide real-time default rates for its India Field Partners. Please visit <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/india"">kiva.org/india</a> for more information.","In May 2014, three of Lumni Chile's loans on Kiva were accidentally defaulted in Kiva's system. This does not effect the clients' payments in actuality and Kiva and Lumni have every expectation that the clients will continue paying off their loans for the duration of their loan term. Though these clients will appear as ""Defaulted"" and anonymized on Kiva's website, and Lumni Chile's default rate will appear artificially inflated, we want to stress that this does not reflect their arrears in reality. Kiva apologies for this confusion and is working with the field partner to fix this issue so it does not occur moving forward.","FUNDAPECs current default rate is not an accurate representation of the loan portfolio because their only ended loan was mistakenly defaulted.

Argentina, which was temporarily unclassified in July 2016 pending release of revised national accounts statistics, is classified as upper middle income for FY17 as of September 29, 2016.

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.",Fiscal year end: June 30; reporting period for national accounts data: FY.
