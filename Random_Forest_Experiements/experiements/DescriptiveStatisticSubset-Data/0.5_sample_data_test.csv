[He was killed by an   felon with a violent record, an illegal immigrant whom the federal government had caught and released. My son is gone because of the lawless immigration policies of the Obama Administration â  policies that we can trust Ted Cruz to change. Cruz has the courage to do it, and the proven record that he will.  The criminal who murdered my son, Apolinar Altamirano, is a   member of the Mexican Mafia and claims to have ties to the Sinaloa Drug Cartel. He came to this country illegally and was first arrested in August 2012 for brutally kidnapping and sexually assaulting a young woman. Despite the violence, Altamirano was sentenced to just two years of probation under a plea agreement. He was turned over to the federal government. And under the âprioritiesâ of the Obama Administration, they â  unbelievably â  released this   felon into our streets on a $10, 000 bond to wait for a deportation hearing, a hearing that never happened. Meanwhile, as he roamed the streets for two years after his release, two orders of protection were filed against him, including one by a woman who said she feared for her life. The federal government apparently knew about the protection orders, yet they let Altamirano remain free. Because the Obama Administration was willing to ignore all of this, Altamirano was free to murder my son. This lawlessness is not an exception â  itâs the Obama rule. In 2013, the Obama Administration caught and released over 104, 000 criminal illegal aliens.    thousand criminals who had come here illegally had committed additional crimes, including murder and rape had been in government custody and then had been released. A single one caused the death of my son. I shudder to think what pain and harm thousands more such criminal have brought, and will bring, to other American families. *   *   * My son Grant was 21 years old. He worked at a Mesa convenience store called QuikTrip. Just before 4:00 a. m. on January 22, 2015, Altamirano walked in, spilled change on the counter and demanded a pack of cigarettes. As Grant began counting the money, the man put a gun to his head shouting, âYouâre not gonna take my money,â and âYouâre not gonna give me my cigarettes. â Grant quickly handed over the cigarettes, but this   criminal shot him anyway, killing him point blank. Grant was not only my son. He was a brother, a nephew, a grandson. His smile brought joy to everyone he met. He loved exploring the desert near our home on his   and cheering on the Denver Broncos during football season. Grant would have turned 23 this March. But he will never celebrate another birthday â  because of an evil murderer who was let loose by a complicit federal government. The federal government could have saved my son by simply enforcing the law instead, it let a criminal illegal alien who had been convicted of a felony go free to wait for a deportation hearing that never came. Even worse: the    directive came to the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from our Commander in Chief. A Commander in Chief who seems to put the comfort of criminals over the lives and safety of our children. *   *   * This election season, weâre being promised a lot of things by a lot of candidates. The most important question for fathers like me â  for every parent who cares about the safety of our children â  is who will keep his word? Who has the record, and the courage, and the political will to finally secure the border, end    policies, and stop illegal immigration? Ted Cruz is the only candidate whose actions match his words, who has a record to prove that he will secure the border, deport criminal illegal aliens, and end illegal immigration. Donald Trump talks a good game, but talk is cheap. Donald Trump employs illegal immigrants. Whatâs more, his vow to deport lots of people is just another plan for âtouchbackâ citizenship, where illegal aliens are sent home but can then turn right around, hop back into the country, and become a citizen. Thatâs not real deportation â  it seems more like the practices that led to a   felon deportee being allowed to murder another one of our children, Kate Steinle. Kate was killed on the San Francisco pier just a few months after Grantâs death. Marco Rubio had his chance to secure the border. When he ran for the Senate, he promised his constituents in Florida that he would do it â  the way heâs promising the same to the American people now. But when he had his chance, he joined Obama and the Democrats in siding with illegal immigrants. He didnât propose to secure the border first, to stop    or to end sanctuary cities. Thatâs no surprise, given that he has supported amnesty as far back as 1998. Heâs repeatedly broken his promise to Americans we cannot and should not trust him to keep us safe. Ted Cruz led the fight against the    Gang of Eight   bill. He is the only candidate who has promised â  on his First Day as President â  to end Obamaâs executive amnesty. Rubio says the same thing in English, but admitted during a Spanish interview that he wonât immediately undo Obamaâs executive amnesty. Ted Cruz introduced Kateâs law to ensure that criminals like the one who killed my son are locked up and, once deported, can never come back to the United States. He also sponsored legislation to end sanctuary cities and stop    policies. Most recently, Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions introduced legislation to make sure that ICE officials have the funding they need to enforce the law and protect us from illegal immigration. Since 2013, when he defeated the    Gang of Eight bill, Cruz has been fighting to secure the border, and he is the only one with a detailed immigration plan that tells us exactly what heâll do as President. So we know what Ted Cruz will do when he gets in the White House: he will enforce the law, secure the border, and keep violent   criminals away from our sons and daughters. He will do what the Obama Administration has refused to do, and what no other candidate has proven willing to do: prioritize the safety of Americans above the comfort of illegal immigrants. I cannot bring my son back, but I can support Ted Cruz for President so that no parent has to go through the grief that my family and I now endure. So that our suffering will not be in vain. We will do our part to nominate a candidate who will restore the rule of law and protect our safety and security.

The absence of Kim    â   the eldest son of the family, who was bound by Korean tradition to preside over the funeral  â   was all the evidence outside analysts needed to see how isolated he had become from the center of power in North Korea, the worldâs most secretive regime. Never fully accepted by his family, sidelined by his powerful stepmother and haunted by fears of assassins, Mr. Kim lived much of his life wandering abroad, in Moscow, Geneva, Beijing, Paris and Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave. On Monday, Mr. Kim, 45, met his end at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. According to the National Intelligence Service of South Korea, he was poisoned by two women who appeared to be carrying out an assassination order from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr. Kim died on his way to the hospital. Two women have been detained in connection with the killing. It remains uncertain if Mr. Kim was traveling alone or if bodyguards were present. It was also unclear how many people were involved in the attack. Grainy footage released on Wednesday showed a woman suspected of being one of the assassins, who appeared to be of Asian descent and wore a shirt emblazoned with âLOLâ in large letters, before she fled the airport. The Royal Malaysia Police announced late Wednesday afternoon that they had arrested a woman that morning and that she had been carrying a Vietnamese passport in Terminal 2, where the attack occurred. They said she was âpositively identifiedâ from   video, and was alone at the time of her arrest. She was identified as Doan Thin Hoang, 28, according to the inspector general of the police, Khalid Abu Bakar. On Thursday, the Malaysian police said they had detained a second suspect, a woman with an Indonesian passport. A police official told the Bernama news agency that more arrests were expected. The authorities also said that an autopsy on Mr. Kim had been completed. There were no markers or police tape at Terminal 2 on Wednesday to indicate that a crime had been committed. Airport workers said that they had been ordered not to discuss the case. South Koreaâs acting president, Hwang   said on Wednesday that his government was working with the Malaysian authorities to find the assailants. But officials in Seoul quickly pointed fingers at Mr. Kimâs half brother, the North Korean leader Kim   who has ordered the executions of  a number of senior officials, including his own uncle, who have been deemed potential challenges to his authority. Ever since Kim   succeeded his father in 2011, âthere has been a standing orderâ to assassinate his half brother, Lee   the director of the Southâs National Intelligence Service, said during a   briefing at the National Assembly, according to lawmakers who attended it. âThis is not a calculated action to remove Kim   because he was a challenge to power per se, but rather reflected Kim  âs paranoia,â Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. Kim   wanted his half brother killed, Mr. Lee said, and there was an assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid of assassins that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012. âPlease withdraw the order to punish me and my family,â Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. âWe have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape is to choose suicide. â Mr. Lee said that Kim   had no power base inside North Korea, where Kim   had swiftly established his monolithic rule with what the South called a reign of terror. Kim   arrived in Malaysia last week, Mr. Lee said. He was in line at the airport to check in for a flight to Macau on Monday morning when he was attacked by the two women, Mr. Lee said, citing security camera footage from the airport. The women fled the airport in a taxi, Mr. Lee said. If North Koreaâs involvement is proved, Washington could face intense pressure to put the country back on its list of nations that sponsor terrorism, said Cheong   an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. North Korea was first put on the terrorism list after the South caught a woman from the North who confessed to planting a bomb on a South Korean airliner that exploded over the Indian Ocean, near Myanmar, in 1987. The North was taken off the list in 2008, after a deal aimed at ending its nuclear program. South Koreaâs military plans to use loudspeakers along the shared Korean border to inform North Koreans of Mr. Kimâs killing and of their governmentâs brutality, a South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported on Wednesday. The Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report. âBy assassinating Kim   Kim   may have removed a thorn in the side, but it will further isolate his country,â Mr. Cheong said. âIt is also expected to worsen his countryâs relations with China, which has been protecting his brother. â Kim  âs life illuminates the hidden intrigue in the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for almost seven decades. While the lives of the rest of the family remained shrouded in mystery, Mr. Kim, the oldest of three known sons of Kim   has been the closest thing the isolated Stalinist state has had to an international playboy. He was often seen with fashionably dressed women in international airports and spent much of his time in  casinos in Macau, where he also kept an expensive house. Outside analysts often saw him as a possible candidate to replace Kim   if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state. Chinese experts on North Korea said they doubted that Kim   had special security protection from Beijing. âChinese elites had no expectation this guy could play an important political role,â said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. âIf China wanted to use him as an alternative leader, China would have offered good protection, but this assassination shows he had no security protection. â In Macau, where Mr. Kim was headed, he was safe just by being there, said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. âMacau is part of China and is a safe haven in itself,â he said. Mr. Kim was a prince in exile with little chance of returning home, analysts and officials in South Korea said. His wife and a daughter and son are in Macau under Chinese protection, Mr. Lee said. The South Korean intelligence agency did not disclose how it had obtained the letter from Mr. Kim begging his half brother to spare his life. But government sources said that emails Mr. Kim sent home through North Korean embassies had been obtained in a hacking operation. In one of the emails, they said, Mr. Kim bitterly complained that the North Korean government stopped sending him cash after his father died and Kim   took over. In 2012, a news report said Mr. Kim was thrown out of a luxury Macau hotel, unable to pay a $15, 000 bill. The Kim family has never been known for its togetherness. Kim  âs mother, Sung   a decorated âpeopleâs actress,â was already married and the mother of a child when Kim   forced her to divorce her novelist husband to marry him. Kim   adored his first son, Kim  . He once seated his young son at his desk and told him, âThis is the place where you will one day give orders,â according to Lee   a relative who defected to the South in 1982. But Kim  âs grandfather, the Northâs founding president, Kim   never approved of the marriage. âMy father was keeping highly secret the fact that he was living with my mother, who was married, a famous movie actress, so I couldnât get out of the house or make friends,â Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a 2012 book by a Japanese journalist. âThat solitude from childhood may have made me what I am now, preferring freedom. â Mr. Kim was born in secret, and when his mother fell out of favor with Kim   and was forced to live in Moscow, he was left in the care of her sister. He was later sent to Geneva, where he learned English and French. (His mother was alone in Moscow when she died in 2002.) Kim   would later begin a relationship with Ko   a star of Pyongyangâs premier opera, who gave birth to Kim   and then Kim  . According to a Japanese sushi chef who published a 2003 memoir about his experience working for the Kim family, Kim   was by that time the fatherâs favorite. Kim   squandered what little chance he may have had to succeed his father when he embarrassed Pyongyang in 2001 he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport from the Dominican Republic. He told Japanese investigators that he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. But rumors of intrigue never left Mr. Kim, as analysts speculated that if the young, inexperienced Kim   failed to meet the expectations of   generals, they might summon home the eldest brother. In a way, Mr. Kim helped fuel such rumors. In the 2012 book by the Japanese journalist, Mr. Kim called his younger brother âa figurehead. â","WASHINGTON  â   The Justice Department warned the State of North Carolina on Wednesday that its new law limiting bathroom access violated the civil rights of transgender people, a finding that could mean millions of dollars in lost federal funds. In a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory, Vanita Gupta, the top civil rights lawyer for the Justice Department, said that âboth you and the State of North Carolinaâ were in violation of civil rights law, and gave him until Monday to decide âwhether you will remedy these violations. â A Justice Department official said that federal officials hoped that the state would agree to comply voluntarily with federal civil rights law by abandoning the measure. But the department has a number of tools it can use to try to force compliance, including denying federal funds or asking a court to do so, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ultimatum escalated a contentious national debate over North Carolinaâs new legal stance on transgender and gay people, and set up what could be a lengthy showdown between the state and the Obama administration. In a statement, Mr. McCrory, a Republican, said: âThe right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy. We will be reviewing to determine the next steps. â Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, accused the Justice Department of âa gross overreachâ that he said âdeserves to be struck down in federal court. â Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, called the letter an attempt to âcircumvent the will of the electorate and instead unilaterally exert its extreme agenda. â The state measure, House Bill 2, known as HB2, was signed into law in March and says the bathroom a person uses is determined by his or her biological gender at birth. That requirement âis facially discriminatory against transgender employeesâ because it treats them differently from other employees, Ms. Gupta wrote. As a result, âwe have concluded that in violation of Title VII, the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII right by employees of public agencies,â she said. The letter was first reported by The Charlotte Observer. The law has become an issue in the presidential campaign and has prompted boycotts of North Carolina from celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, as well as calls for repeal by a number of businesses, some of which have canceled plans to create new jobs in the state. Opponents cheered the Justice Departmentâs move. âI think it makes clear what weâve known all along, which is that HB2 is deeply discriminatory and violates civil rights law in all kinds of manners,â said State Representative Chris Sgro of Greensboro. Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, an L. G. B. T. rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that âactions have consequences, and Governor McCrory and his legislative allies are now paying the price for this   law that they so hurriedly enacted. âHB2 is a solution in a search of a problem that simply doesnât exist, and lawmakers must take immediate action to fully repeal it,â he said. âThe stateâs economy and reputation have suffered enough, and now students all across the state stand to lose out on nearly $1 billion in critical funding because of HB2. The livelihoods of North Carolinaâs families are at stake, and there is no excuse for inaction. â In December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr. directed the Justice Department to begin including gender identity  â   including transgender status  â   as a basis for discrimination claims under federal civil rights law. That decision reversed a policy at the Justice Department that specifically excluded transgender people from federal protection. Mr. Holder called the decision âan important shift,â meant to affirm the Justice Departmentâs commitment âto protecting the civil rights of all Americans. â In addition, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission held last year that âequal access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of employmentâ and that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory, Ms. Gupta noted, in her letter to Mr. McCrory. The Justice Departmentâs threat was not the only front opened Wednesday in the battle over transgender bathroom rights. In Illinois, a group calling itself Students and Parents for Privacy filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, the Justice Department, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the school directors of Township High School District 211 in Cook County, Ill. seeking to stop the district from âforcing   to    girls to use locker rooms and restrooms with biological males. â In November, federal education authorities ruled that the school district, near Chicago, violated Title IX, the federal law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public education, when it did not allow a transgender student who said she identifies as a girl to change and shower in the girlsâ locker room without restrictions. The fact that the student, who is biologically male, now uses the bathroom and locker rooms at William Fremd High School, the lawsuit states, creates an âintimidating and hostile environmentâ for girls, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois. The suit also asks the court to set aside a Department of Education rule in which transgender students are covered under Title IX. Meanwhile, in Oxford, Ala. the City Council on Wednesday rescinded an ordinance it had passed the week before that forbade people to use a public restroom that did not match their gender at birth, according to the Alabama news website al. com. The news service reported that at least one of the three members who voted to rescind the ordinance in the   vote was influenced by a city attorneyâs opinion that the ordinance might be illegal under Title IX.","DALLAS  â   Fearful that the nation is locked in a spiral of violence and discord, many Americans took what refuge they could in church on Sunday. In tiny storefronts and suburban megachurches, worshipers mourned the deaths of five Dallas police officers at the hands of an   sniper who was aiming to kill white officers at a demonstration against police violence. They also grieved for two   men killed in shootings by the police in Baton Rouge, La. and Minnesota. Some prayed for the souls of the men who pulled the triggers. Some thanked God for the sacrifices the police made daily to protect their cities. Some thanked God for the technology that allowed the world to see controversial acts of police violence toward  . At St. Patrickâs Cathedral in New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan spoke of a country âworried, frustrated and fatigued over senseless violence. â âFrom Minnesota to Louisiana and Texas, one nation under God examines its soul,â he said. âSadness and heaviness is especially present in our   and law enforcement communities. â The turbulence felt close, sometimes distressingly so, for many churchgoers. Protests had roiled the streets of San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, among other cities, hours before sunrise. In Dallas, drivers had to maneuver on Sunday morning around a   crime scene that remained closed off in the heart of downtown, where Micah Johnson, a    former Army reservist, used a semiautomatic weapon last week to kill the five officers and wound seven others, as well as two civilians, before the police killed him with a   explosive device. A few blocks from the scene, Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas gave an interview on Sunday on CBSâs âFace the Nation,â posing questions about his city that many Americans, Christian and   alike, had begun asking about the nation as a whole. âCan we, in a moment of crisis, when officers are fallen, forgive?â Mr. Rawlings said. âCan we disagree without demonizing? Can we see a better narrative, as opposed to just absurdity, that thereâs redemption as we build this great city?â Mr. Rawlings, who is white, also attended a service at the Potterâs House Church, the huge Dallas congregation led by the   televangelist T . D. Jakes. The service was more of a town hall event promising âtools on reconciling and moving forward. â The cityâs police chief, David O. Brown, and other officers were in attendance. Among the panelists and   participants were relatives of Alton Sterling, the black man killed in Louisiana, and the girlfriend of Philando Castile, the black motorist shot to death in Minnesota. Nine miles away, on the outskirts of South Dallas, Pastor Frederick Douglass Haynes III addressed a congregation of hundreds, most of them black, at   Baptist Church. He told them he was not interested in preaching a message of reconciliation if that did not come with change, or of healing if that simply meant patching over the injustice that had led to last weekâs violence. âWe canât have normal church today,â he said, explaining that he was tired of delivering services after such tragedies, naming Tamir Rice, Walter Scott and Eric Garner. Calling the nation a racial powder keg, Pastor Haynes said, âYou wonât have unity as long as you have structured injustice. â âThe Bible says injustice is a sin,â he added. âThe Bible says oppression is a sin. â Pastor Haynesâs daughter was at the Dallas protest on Thursday night and was   with him from her phone when the shooting began. Pastor Haynes, who said he had watched his daughterâs proud smile transform into screams, struck out at those trying to blame the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for the attack, calling it âracist gall. â âThat was a peaceful march,â he said. âPolice and protesters were taking selfies. â At Watermark Community Church in Dallas, those who dropped off their children for Sunday school walked by the place where Sgt. Michael J. Smith had stood for years, sometimes on Sundays, sometimes during the week, by the glass doors leading to the preschool classrooms. He had been there the previous Sunday, but he was not there for this one. Sergeant Smith, who provided security at the church while off duty and was also a member, was one of the sniperâs victims on Thursday night. That evening, Watermarkâs senior pastor, Todd Wagner, posted a letter online to Dallas residents. The city, he said, was âa war zone. â âAs part of that war, darkness has been growing in our country because for some time leaders and citizens alike have mockedâ the light of God, he wrote. Onstage Sunday, Pastor Wagner reiterated that theme but also called for a greater sense of understanding among the races. âThey very first time I heard âBlack lives matter,â I was like: âWhat? Why would you make such a racist statement? ââ Pastor Wagner, who is white, said during an impassioned sermon. Later, he said, he realized that he needed to listen to those making the declaration, try to understand the source of their hurt, love them and preach the Gospel. Others, he said, would be wise to do the same  â   to respond to âBlack lives matterâ with âLet me understand your pain,â and to show âthat white men do care. â In Baton Rouge, about 20 worshipers, nearly all of them black, gathered at the Ark of Safety, a storefront church sometimes attended by relatives of Mr. Sterling, who was selling CDs in a parking lot before he was killed by the police on Tuesday. The Rev. Tommie Gordon told congregants that if they trusted in the world, they would be lost  â   that if they demanded justice from the world, they would be lost. âWhen things are going wrong, people always want to shout about it,â he said. âNobodyâs going to listen. This is the time to get on your knees and pray. â There is nothing wrong with lawful protest, he said. But he added, more than once, âIâve never seen Jesus at a protest. â Brandon Lee, 22, who knew Mr. Sterling and whose father bought CDs from him, expressed a belief that did not exactly echo the message of the service. âI just really feel like it starts with man,â he said, speaking of the need for justice. âIf you fix man, you fix the world. â Elsewhere, easy answers seemed equally difficult to come by. At Nativity Lutheran Church in St. Anthony, Minn. not far from where Officer Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed Mr. Castile, the Rev. Glenn Seefeldt called for prayers for both men. âWe want to be able to be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem,â he said. âBut where do we start?â Pastor Seefeldt, whose congregation is mostly white, mentioned âwhite privilegeâ and urged members to think deeply about their actions and hidden biases. âI have a real and tremendous guilt response,â he said. âWhat have I done to contribute to racism as a white male?â This peculiar and tangled American moment seemed even more vexing for Rose Tolbert, 58, a member of the   church in Dallas. Ms. Tolbert works for the Dallas County Sheriffâs Department and has two sons in law enforcement. Ms. Tolbert is also   and she had wanted to attend Thursdayâs protest in a stand against police killings of black men but had to work that night. When she got news of the shootings, she called to make sure her family was O. K. Then she fell asleep crying over the tragedy that had befallen her fellow law enforcement officers. At the same time, she remained devastated by the deaths of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile. On Sunday morning, her preacher invited her to the altar for a special prayer for law enforcement officers and their families, for protesters, and for children who he said were being traumatized by violence. Ms. Tolbert went to the altar, then returned with tears streaming down her face. âI needed consolation  â   I needed the word from God,â she said, her voice breaking. She paused and then collapsed against a pole in the church lobby, sobbing. âI came here to get refilled,â she said. âWe need to pray and get active. We need to stand up. â"

Moreover, many countries do not estimate all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total.

Measures of growth in consumption and capital formation are subject to two kinds of inaccuracy. The first stems from the difficulty of measuring expenditures at current price levels. The second arises in deflating current price data to measure volume growth, where results depend on the relevance and reliability of the price indexes and weights used. Measuring price changes is more difficult for investment goods than for consumption goods because of the one-time nature of many investments and because the rate of technological progress in capital goods makes capturing change in quality difficult. (An example is computers - prices have fallen as quality has improved.)

To obtain government consumption in constant prices, countries may deflate current values by applying a wage (price) index or extrapolate from the change in government employment. Neither technique captures improvements in productivity or changes in the quality of government services.",,,"Complete vital registration systems are fairly uncommon in developing countries. Thus estimates must be obtained from sample surveys or derived by applying indirect estimation techniques to registration, census, or survey data. Survey data are subject to recall error, and surveys estimating infant/child deaths require large samples because households in which a birth has occurred during a given year cannot ordinarily be preselected for sampling. Indirect estimates rely on model life tables that may be inappropriate for the population concerned. Extrapolations based on outdated surveys may not be reliable for monitoring changes in health status or for comparative analytical work.","Consumer price indexes should be interpreted with caution. The definition of a household, the basket of goods, and the geographic (urban or rural) and income group coverage of consumer price surveys can vary widely by country. In addition, weights are derived from household expenditure surveys, which, for budgetary reasons, tend to be conducted infrequently in developing countries, impairing comparability over time. Although useful for measuring consumer price inflation within a country, consumer price indexes are of less value in comparing countries."

Moreover, they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries. Under-five mortality rates are higher for boys than for girls in countries in which parental gender preferences are insignificant. Under-five mortality captures the effect of gender discrimination better than infant mortality does, as malnutrition and medical interventions have more significant impacts to this age group. Where female under-five mortality is higher, girls are likely to have less access to resources than boys.",

We should update the manifest file so it does not contain this permission. Then it will not need to be updated on upload to the web store.  ","ARC runtime version: ToTApp version: ToTCurrently, we have two filtering logic for the run_integration_tests.- Name based filtering.- Expectation based running decision.Also, we have two phases of the filtering.1) At first phase:If name based filter is set (-t, -x options), we just follow them.Otherwise we apply expectation based filtering.- Pass/Flaky tests are included, and others are excluded by default.- If --include-failing, --include-large, and/or --include-timeout is set, we follow the flags respectively. NOT_SUPPORTED is always excluded.2) At second phase:- Traversing the list built at first phase, we decide which tests should run.- NOT_SUPPORTED tests will never run (even the name is specified by -t option).- TIMEOUT tests will run only when --include-timeout is set (again, even the name is specified by -t).- All other tests will run.It sounds fairly complicated. And I would like to simplify it as follows.1) At first phase:- Include all tests, regardless expectations, by default.- If any filters is set, follow it.2) Decide whether we run the tests built at first phase.- Run PASS/FLAKY tests only by default.- Run FAIL/LARGE/TIMEOUT tests followed by --include-* flags.From the users' (I mean developers' = ARC team) point of view,the only diff should be whether tests marked as FAIL or LARGE will run or not when -t is set but --include-* is not.Before the change, these would run. After, not.I think the behavior change would be ok, considering the following case:There are tests:Fixture1#test1Fixture1#test2   :Fixture1#test60 (or more).Fixture2#test1And, some are marked FAIL.Then, ./run_integration_tests (w/o flags) skips FAILed tests. We sometimes want to run Fixture1# tests only. However, ./run_integration_tests -t Fixture1#* also runs FAILed tests, now.Someone thinks this is expected, but others not.Specifically, we now do not have a way to exclude FAILed tests easily, except listing all FAILed test names with -x. So, supporting it would be beneficial.If we want to use the current behavior (running FAILed and LARGE tests matched with -t), what we need to do is just adding --include-* in addition to -t. I believe this is fine enough.WDYT? ","Right-click a dom node that has some attribute.  Double-click on the attribute in the inspector.  Delete the trailing "" mark from the attribute value.

During the day he ran to the south quarter south-east, a distance of thirteen and a half leagues. He saw ring-tails and much grass and many tunny-fish {toninas}.","As it rained and the sky was clouded they did not start. Some of the Christians reached another village near by in the direction of the north-west, and they found nothing and no one in the houses: and on the way they encountered an old man who could not flee from them: they took him and said to him that they did not wish to do him harm, and they gave him some trifles from the articles of barter and left him. The Admiral would have liked to see him to clothe him and talk with him, because he was greatly pleased with the felicity of that land and its disposition to make a settlement in it, and he judged that there must be large villages. They found in one house a cake of wax, which he brought to the Sovereigns and he says that where there is wax there must also be a thousand other good things. The sailors also found in one house the head of a man in a little basket covered with another little basket and fastened to a post of the house and in the same manner they found another in another village. The Admiral believed that they must be the heads of some principal persons of the family, because those houses were such that many people could take refuge in one alone, and they must be relations descended from one person alone.","At midnight he raised the sails with the wind south-east and navigated to the east-north-east: he arrived at a point which he called Punta Roja which is exactly to the east of the Monte-Cristi a distance of sixty miles, and in the shelter of this point he anchored in the afternoon, three hours before nightfall. He did not dare to go out from there in the night as there were many reefs, until they were investigated because afterward they would be useful if they had, as they must have, channels, and the water inside is very deep and forms a secure anchorage from all winds. These lands from Monte-Cristi as far as the place where he was anchored are high and smooth lands and are very pretty fields and back of them there are very beautiful mountains which extend from east to west, and are all cultivated and green, so that it is a wonderful thing to see their beauty, and they have many rivers of water. In all this land there are many tortoises, of which the sailors took a great many which came on land to lay their eggs, on Monte-Cristi, and they were very large like a great wooden shield. The day before this when the Admiral was going to the Rio del Oro, he said he saw three sirens which came up very high out of the sea: but they were not as beautiful as they are painted, as in some ways they are formed like a man in the face. He said that at other times he saw some in Guinea on the coast of Manegueta. He says that this night in the name of our Lord he will start on his journey without delaying himself further for any matter, since he had found what he had sought, and as he did not wish to have more trouble with that Martin Alonso until their Highnesses learned the news of the voyage and what he has done. """"And then he says I will not suffer the bad deeds of persons without virtue, who, with little respect, presume to carry out their own wills in opposition to those who did them honour.""""","""""At 10 o'clock I arrived here at this point of the islet and anchored as did also the caravels: and after having eaten, I landed. There was no other village here except one house, in which I did not find any one, as I believe they had fled through fear because all their domestic utensils were in the house. I did not allow my people to touch anything but I went with them and with these captains and people to see the island. If the other islands already seen are very beautiful, green and fertile, this one is much more so and has very large green groves. There are some large lakes here and upon them and around them, there are wonderful groves. They are very green here as well as in all the island and the grass is the same as it is in April in Andalusia. And the singing of the little birds is such that it appears a man would wish never to leave here, and the flocks of parrots obscure the sun. And there are large and small birds of so many kinds and so different from ours, that it is wonderful. And then there are a thousand kinds of trees, each with its own fruit and they are all wonderfully odoriferous. I am the most troubled man in the world that I do not know them, because I am very certain that they are all valuable things and I am bringing specimens of them and also of the herbs. In walking thus around one of these lakes I saw a serpent which we killed and I am bringing the skin to your Highnesses. When it saw us, it threw itself into the lake and we followed it there, as the water was not very deep, until we killed it with spears. It is seven palms in length. I believe there are many serpents like this one here in this lake. Here I recognised some aloes and to-morrow I have determined to have ten quintals brought to the ship, because they tell me it is very valuable. Also in searching for good water, we went to a village near here, a half league from where I am anchored: and the people of this village, as they saw us, all took to flight and left their houses, and hid their clothing ropas and what they possessed in the mountain. I did not allow anything to be taken, not the value of a pin. Afterward some of the men approached us and one came quite up to us. I gave him some hawk's bells and some little glass beads and he was very much pleased and very joyful. And that the friendship might increase and that I might require something of them, I asked him for water. And after I went on board the ship, they then came to the shore with their gourds full, and were very much pleased to give it to us. And I ordered that another string of little glass beads should be given them, and they said that they would come here to-morrow. I wished to fill all the ship's butts with water here; therefore, if the weather permits, I will then start and sail around this island, until I have speech with the King and see if I can obtain from him the gold which I hear he wears. And afterward I will leave for another very large island which I believe must be Cipango, according to the indications which those Indians I am taking with me, give me, and which they call Colba. They say that at this island there are many large ships and many skilled seamen. Near this island there is another which they call Bosio, which they say is also very large. And I will see the other islands which lie between in passing, and according to whether I find a quantity of gold or spices, I will determine what must be done. But still, I have determined to go to the mainland to the city of Guisay and give your Highnesses' letters to the Great Khan, and beg for a reply and come back with it.""""","As the wind continued contrary he did not start from that harbour and he decided to go and see a very beautiful cape a quarter of a league from the harbour in the direction of the south-east: he went with the boats and some armed people: at the foot of the cape there was the mouth of a good river. He turned his prow to the south-east in order to enter and it was a hundred paces in width: it was a fathom deep at the entrance or in the mouth; but inside it was twelve fathoms, or five, and four, and two, and would contain as many ships as there are in Spain. Passing a branch of that river he went to the south-east and found a small bay or inlet in which he saw five very large rafts which the Indians call canoes, like fustas, very beautiful, and carved so that he says it was a pleasure to see them and at the foot of the mountain he saw that the land was all cultivated. They were under some very thick trees and in going along a path which led to them, they came across a ship yard very well arranged and covered so that neither the sun nor the water could do injury, and in it there was another canoe made of wood like the rest, like a fusta with seventeen benches for the rowers: it was a pleasure to see how it was constructed and its beauty. He ascended a mountain and then he found it all level and sowed with many products of the land and gourds, and it was delightful to see it: and in the midst of it there was a large village. He came suddenly upon the people of the village and as they saw the Spaniards they started to flee. The Indian whom the Spaniards had with them reassured them saying that they must not be afraid as they were good people. The Admiral caused them to be given hawks' bells and rings of brass and little green and yellow glass beads, with which they were much pleased. He saw that they had no gold nor any other precious thing and that it was sufficient to leave them in security and that all the surrounding territory was populated and that at the others fled through fear: and the Admiral assures the Sovereigns that ten men cause ten thousand Indians to flee. They are such cowards and so fearful that they carry no arms except spears, and on the end of the spears they have a small sharp stick which is hardened. He decided to return. He says that he easily took all the spears away from them, trading for them so that they gave away all they had. Having returned to the place where he had left the boats he sent certain Christians to the place where he had ascended, because it appeared to him that he had seen a large apiary. Before these people whom he had sent, returned, many Indians gathered and came to the boats where the Admiral had already united all his people. One of them went forward into the water near to the stern of the boat, and made a long speech which the Admiral did not understand, except that the other Indians from time to time raised their hands to heaven and shouted loudly. The Admiral thought they were re-assuring him and that his coming pleased them; but he saw the Indian he was taking with him change countenance and become yellow like wax and tremble greatly, saying by signs that the Admiral must go away out of the river as the Indians wished to kill them: and he approached a Christian who had a loaded cross-bow and showed it to the Indians and the Admiral understood that he said to them that it would kill them all because that cross-bow went a long ways and killed. He also took a sword and drew it from the scabbard, showing it to them and saying the same thing and when they heard that, they all commenced to flee, leaving the said Indian still trembling through cowardice and lack of courage, and he was a strong man and of good stature. The Admiral would not go out of the river but rather made them row inland toward the place where the Indians were, who were in great number, all stained with red and naked as their mothers gave them birth and some of them had feathers upon their heads and other plumes, and they all had handfuls of spears. """"I approached them and gave them some mouthfuls of bread and asked them for their spears and I gave them for the spears, to some a small hawk's bell, to others a cheap little brass ring, and to others some worthless little beads: so that they all became pacified and they all came to the boats and gave us whatever they had for whatever was given them. The sailors had killed a tortoise and the pieces of the shell lay in the boat and the boys gave the Indians a piece as large as the finger nail, and the Indians gave them a handful of spears. They are people like the others I have found (says the Admiral) and have the same belief, and they believe that we came from heaven and whatever they have they without saying that it is little then give for whatever may be given them, and I believe that they would do the same with spices and gold if they had them. I saw a beautiful house not very large and having two doors, as they are all built so, and I entered it and saw a wonderful arrangement like chambers constructed in a certain manner which I do not know how to describe, with shells and other things fastened to the ceiling. And I thought it was a temple, and I called them and asked by signs if they prayed in it, and they said no, and one of them went up overhead and gave me all they had there, and I took some of it."""""
